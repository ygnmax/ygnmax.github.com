<p>Managing operational risk is a function of <strong>both internal and external processes</strong> related to cash and securities and managing client accounts and information. The approach must evolve along with changes in technology, markets and regulation.</p>
<p>More traditional monitoring in the form of periodic credit reviews and operational risks associated with transactional banking such as the segregation or safekeeping of client assets or data protection issues are critical risk monitoring functions</p>
<h3 id="People"><a href="#People" class="headerlink" title="People"></a>People</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Key person risk</strong> refers to any institution which relies heavily on one individual,<br>whether that be within senior management or operations</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Processes"><a href="#Processes" class="headerlink" title="Processes"></a>Processes</h3><ul>
<li>Procedural breakdowns in processing and managing market and credit risk as well as meeting compliance and regulatory requirements can create competitive disadvantages or result in opportunity cost and/or actual losses</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Systems"><a href="#Systems" class="headerlink" title="Systems"></a>Systems</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Errors</strong> resulting from outdated systems, lack of systems integration and/or gaps<br>where human intervention is needed can raise costs and lower efficiency</li>

<p><strong>Central Securities Depositories</strong> are entities which record legal entitlements to<br>dematerialized securities and operate transaction settlement systems in those securities Major CSDs, include DTCC, Euroclear and Clearstream</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DTCC (Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, formerly CCS)</strong> DTCC is owned and directed by its users It automates, standardizes, and streamlines capital markets transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>DTC (Depository Trust Corporation) provides clearance, settlement, and information services for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, government and mortgage backed securities, money market instruments, and over the counter derivatives</li>
<li>NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) executes multilateral netting to manage transactions between mutual funds and insurance carriers and their respective investors</li>
<li>FICC (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation) provides clearing for fixed income securities, including Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities, including real time trade matching, clearing, risk management, and netting for trades in US government debt issues, including repurchase agreements or repos</li>

<h3 id="Payment-Networks"><a href="#Payment-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Payment Networks"></a>Payment Networks</h3><p><strong>SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)</strong> is a cooperative utility messaging system formed in 1973 by over 200 banks headquartered in Belgium. In 1977 it replaced Telex technology with a messaging platform to validate and route standardized messages. Over 11 000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries now use SWIFT. As a secure financial messaging system, SWIFT does not perform funds transfer, clearing or settlement. SWIFT payment orders must be settled by correspondent accounts that institutions have with one other.</p>
<p><strong>Fedwire</strong> is a real time gross settlement funds transfer system operated by U S Federal Reserve Banks enabling financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between over 9 000 participants.</p>
<p><strong>Correspondent Banking</strong> Bilateral arrangement, often involving a reciprocal cross border relationship in multiple currencies. A correspondent banking arrangement involves one bank (the correspondent) providing accounts and related services, to another bank (the respondent), often including its affiliates.</p>
<h3 id="Exchanges-and-Clearinghouses"><a href="#Exchanges-and-Clearinghouses" class="headerlink" title="Exchanges and Clearinghouses"></a>Exchanges and Clearinghouses</h3><p><strong>Securities and derivatives exchanges</strong> provide a centralized location where securities are listed and traded by a restricted set of brokers who are members of an exchange; recordkeeping is dematerialized and based upon electronic communication networks.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative trading venues</strong> and systems including dark pools offer private means to conduct securities transactions These venues have faced increased scrutiny and disclosure (under Regulation ATS) given concerns over conflict of interest and other practices<br><strong>Central clearinghouses</strong> (CCPs) are centralized entities including CME and LCH which mutualize counterparty credit risk in the foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, credit, commodity and weather derivative markets in which they operate CCPs aim to reduce settlement risk via several measures</p>
<ul>
<li>Net offsetting trades between multiple counterparties</li>
<li>Require collateral (margin) deposits</li>
<li>Provide independent valuation of trades and collateral</li>
<li>Monitor creditworthiness of member firms, and</li>
<li>Provide a guarantee fund used to cover losses exceeding a defaulting member’s collateral </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of central counterparty clearing arrangements</strong> are greater risk transparency, lower processing costs, and clear rules in cases of member default Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, they are novated to a clearinghouse which steps between trader clearing firms to assumes legal counterparty risk for the trade (a trade between members A and B become two trades A CCP and CCP B)</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong> of central clearing include the concentration of risk which was previously decentralized and distributed in the bilateral OTC model, the interdependency of CCPs, which are now have become crucial financial infrastructures following post crisis reform which forced the over the counter derivatives market into central clearing and the limited capital held by CCPs themselves</p>

<li><strong>Assist in new market expansion Clients considering expansion</strong> to a new market tap custody bank expertise on market structure, requirements and regulation When a custodian opens a new market to clients, network market managers work with local market representatives to understand the market and advocate for infrastructure changes to make markets more acceptable to foreign investors</li>
<li><strong>Asset segregation and ringfencing</strong>: Custodians conduct periodic legal reviews of recoverability of securities held on behalf of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the subcustodian, maintaining omnibus and segregated cash and securities accounts in the name of the bank separate from subcustodian assets where possible</li>

<h2 id="Quantifying-Operating-Risk"><a href="#Quantifying-Operating-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Quantifying Operating Risk"></a>Quantifying Operating Risk</h2><p>Expected versus Unexpected Loss</p>
<p><strong>Basic Indicator Approach</strong></p>
<p>Simplest form for banks without significant international operations Banks using the BIA must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage α of positive annual gross income (excluding year where annual gross income is negative or zero):</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
K_{BIA}=\frac{\sum GI_{1,2,\cdots,n}*\alpha}{n}</script><p><strong>Standard Approach</strong></p>
<p>This methodology used for internationally active institutions divides bank activities into corporate finance, sales trading, retail, commercial banking, payment settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage Gross income serves as a proxy for the scale of the business and operational risk exposure for each segment Capital charges are calculated by multiplying gross income by a β factor which defines the relationship between industry wide operational risk loss experience and gross income</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
K_{\text{TSA}}=\frac{\sum_{\text{years}1-3}\max(\sum_{i=1}^{8}GI_{i}*\beta_i)}{3}</script><p>Standardized Approach Beta Factors The beta factors are a fixed percentage, set by the Committee, relating the level of required capital to the level of the gross income for each of the eight business lines as follows:</p>
