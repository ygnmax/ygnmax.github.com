Emerging fintech-driven non-bank players have increased market share and the proportion of algorithmic trading is rising.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Why-does-the-foreign-exchange-market-have-such-a-size-and-scope"><a href="#Why-does-the-foreign-exchange-market-have-such-a-size-and-scope" class="headerlink" title="Why does the foreign exchange market have such a size and scope"></a>Why does the foreign exchange market have such a size and scope</h3><ul><li>Increasing global interdependence amid growing cross-border financial and goods flows</li><li>Increased wealth and risk appetite drives globalization of investment portfolios</li><li>Continued emerging market growth attracts cross-border capital and goods flows</li></ul><h3 id="Three-primary-foreign-exchange-risk-exposure"><a href="#Three-primary-foreign-exchange-risk-exposure" class="headerlink" title="Three primary foreign exchange risk exposure:"></a>Three primary foreign exchange risk exposure:</h3><ul><li><strong>transaction risk</strong>: the original functional currency value of the transaction will <strong>change or be recorded at a different value</strong></li><li><strong>translation risk</strong>: Firms face the translation of foreign currency denominated balance sheet and income statement items (revenues and expenses) from a foreign currency into its functional currency.</li><li><strong>economic risk</strong>: impact long-term investment decisions</li></ul><h3 id="What-drives-foreign-exchange-rates"><a href="#What-drives-foreign-exchange-rates" class="headerlink" title="What drives foreign exchange rates?"></a>What drives foreign exchange rates?</h3><p>Currency movements are commonly considered as random events more readily explained after the fact than predicted on an ex-ante basis. This would suggest investors are unable to generate alpha while hedgers should only manage FX-based balance sheet and income statement volatility as needed.</p><h2 id="Foreign-Exchange-Rate-Framework"><a href="#Foreign-Exchange-Rate-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Foreign Exchange Rate Framework"></a>Foreign Exchange Rate Framework</h2><h3 id="Monetary-Approach-Purchasing-Power-Parity"><a href="#Monetary-Approach-Purchasing-Power-Parity" class="headerlink" title="Monetary Approach (Purchasing Power Parity)"></a>Monetary Approach (Purchasing Power Parity)</h3><p>Implies an exchange rate should reflect the relative price of the same basket of goods across currencies, or alternatively that the difference in the rate of change in domestic and foreign currency prices (the inflation differential) should equal the percentage depreciation or appreciation of the exchange rate. PPP is too narrow a measure to be used in isolation given the existence of non-standard baskets of goods, non-traded goods and other differences.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p>undervalued:</p><p>A Big Mac costs 130 RUB in Russia and US$5.74 in the U.S. This implies a RUB/USD exchange rate of 22.65. The actual exchange rate of 63.84 RUB/USD suggests the RUB is 64.5% undervalued </p><p>($\frac{63.84 – 22.65}{63.84}$).</p></li><li><p>overvalued:</p><p>A Big Mac costs SFR 6.50 in Switzerland and US$5.74 in the U.S. The implied SFR/USD exchange rate is 1.13. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate of 0.99 SFR/USD suggests the Swiss franc is 14% overvalued </p><p>($\frac{0.99 – 1.13}{0.99}$).</p></li></ul><h3 id="Balance-of-Payments-Approach"><a href="#Balance-of-Payments-Approach" class="headerlink" title="Balance of Payments Approach"></a>Balance of Payments Approach</h3><p>Addresses the implications of trade and capital flows for FX rates, focusing on current (goods, services, dividends and interest) versus capital account (investment, portfolio flows or loans) changes which net to zero. Although in theory any current account imbalances are financed via the capital account, in practice changes to certain components are more material than others, for example commodity-led economies (AUD or BRL) respond more to those flows, while emerging Asia is more impacted by business cycles. Flows matter, but do not explain FX volatility.</p><h3 id="Asset-Markets-Approach"><a href="#Asset-Markets-Approach" class="headerlink" title="Asset Markets Approach"></a>Asset Markets Approach</h3><p>Currencies are highly responsive to current and future fundamentals as embodied in asset prices reflecting the present value of future cash flows denominated in different currencies. Under this explanation, FX prices adjust instantaneously to new information about currency fundamentals. This approach is supported by strong empirical evidence and forms the basis for trading.</p><h3 id="Central-bank-FX-market-intervention"><a href="#Central-bank-FX-market-intervention" class="headerlink" title="Central bank FX market intervention"></a>Central bank FX market intervention</h3><p>This is an additional overlay, particularly in emerging markets driven by an aim to either address an imbalance, offset volatility or accumulate FX reserves.</p><h1 id="Foreign-Exchange-Convention"><a href="#Foreign-Exchange-Convention" class="headerlink" title="Foreign Exchange Convention"></a>Foreign Exchange Convention</h1><h2 id="Inverse-and-direct-quoting"><a href="#Inverse-and-direct-quoting" class="headerlink" title="Inverse and direct quoting"></a>Inverse and direct quoting</h2><h3 id="Inverse-quotes"><a href="#Inverse-quotes" class="headerlink" title="Inverse quotes"></a>Inverse quotes</h3><p>Several major (and a few minor) currencies are quoted as <strong>the number of U.S. dollars required to purchase one unit of currency</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>EUR / USD = 1.11</p><ul><li><strong>Therefore a stronger EUR will result in a higher EUR/USD</strong>, similar to a stock</li></ul></li><li><p>GBP / USD</p></li><li><p>AUD / USD</p></li><li><p>NZD / USD</p></li></ul><h3 id="Direct-quotes"><a href="#Direct-quotes" class="headerlink" title="Direct quotes"></a>Direct quotes</h3><p>For all other currencies, <strong>prices are quoted as the number of units of foreign currency which buys one US dollar</strong></p><ul><li>USD / JPY = 107.8<ul><li>This figure rises as JPY weakens and the USD strengthens</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="Foreign-Exchange-Tools"><a href="#Foreign-Exchange-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Foreign Exchange Tools"></a>Foreign Exchange Tools</h1><h2 id="Spot-and-Forward"><a href="#Spot-and-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Spot and Forward"></a>Spot and Forward</h2><h3 id="Spot"><a href="#Spot" class="headerlink" title="Spot"></a>Spot</h3><h4 id="Spot-FX-mechanics"><a href="#Spot-FX-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Spot FX mechanics"></a>Spot FX mechanics</h4><p>Spot transactions are cash transactions usually settled on <strong>the second business<br>day (T+2) after the trade date</strong> (CAD, TRY, MXN and RUB settle next day) under an agreement between two parties (one of whom is often a bank) to purchase or sell units of a base currency.</p><ul><li><p>Example:</p><p>A EUR/USD quote of 1.1526 [1.15 representing the ‘big figure’, and the 26 expressed as ‘pips’) means a counterparty purchases one EUR in exchange for $1.1526 dollars. </p></li><li><p>Spot trade exposure is referred to as <strong>settlement risk</strong>, which arises <strong>when one party transfers funds in one currency in anticipation of receiving payment in another currency from another party</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Spot comprises less than half of overall FX volume, as market participants usually manage forecasted transaction risks using FX derivatives.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Forward"><a href="#Forward" class="headerlink" title="Forward"></a>Forward</h3><p>These involve the exchange of one currency for another at a pre-agreed rate on a pre-determined date ranging from T+3 to several weeks or years. This is the formula:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">F = S_0 \frac{(1+y_{US})^T}{(1+y_{FC})^T}</script><p>In continuous time:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_t = S_0e^{(r-r_f)t}</script><ul><li><p>Example:</p><p>Assume the spot EUR/USD FX rate is 1.10 (i.e., US$ 1.10 buys one euro). If the EUR one  year benchmark rate is -0.4% and an equivalent USD one-year benchmark is 2.00%, solve for the one year EUR / USD forward rate.</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1.10 \times\frac{1+0.02}{1-0.004}=1.1265</script><p>Note that the higher the interest rate in USD in this case, the more expensive it is to purchase EUR in one year’s time given that the buyer foregoes one year of the higher USD interest.</p></li></ul><h4 id="Forward-Contract-mechanics"><a href="#Forward-Contract-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Forward Contract mechanics"></a>Forward Contract mechanics</h4><p>Foreign exchange forward transactions are quoted in ‘<strong>points</strong>’, or the (positive or negative) <strong>difference in the forward and spot quote</strong> scaled to the last decimal in the corresponding spot quote.</p><ul><li><p>Example: </p><p>the one-year forward rate of +265 points would apply to EUR/USD in our above example, the corresponding forward rate being 1.10 + (265/10,000) = 1.1265. Many firms <strong>hedge transaction exposure for relatively certain forecasted transactions</strong> such as <strong>accounts receivable</strong> or <strong>payable</strong> as well as investment exposures using currency forward transactions.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Non-deliverable-FX-forwards-swaps-and-options"><a href="#Non-deliverable-FX-forwards-swaps-and-options" class="headerlink" title="Non-deliverable FX forwards, swaps and options"></a>Non-deliverable FX forwards, swaps and options</h2><ul><li><p>Exchange Rate Restrictions </p><p>Although freely floating currencies are predominant among major industrial nations, only around 30 global currencies are freely floating, with others (mostly emerging markets (EM) currencies) subject to controls such as restrictions on trading or exchanging currencies.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Non-Deliverable-FX-Forwards-NDFs"><a href="#Non-Deliverable-FX-Forwards-NDFs" class="headerlink" title="Non-Deliverable FX Forwards (NDFs)"></a>Non-Deliverable FX Forwards (NDFs)</h3><p>These are similar to standard forward agreements in that they involve the exchange of one currency’s value for another at a pre-agreed rate on a pre-determined date. However, <strong>given onshore currency restrictions</strong>, they are settled in <strong>a convertible currency (usually USD) offshore without a physical exchange of the hedged currency</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Example:</p><p>A corporation enters into a $1 million NDF to purchase BRL and sell USD for settlement in one month at a forward rate of 3.79 BRL/USD. </p><ul><li>In one month, the NDF breaks even if USD 1,000,000 = BRL 3,790,000. </li><li>If BRL strengthens to 3.70 instead, the BRL buyer has a gain of BRL 90,000 on the fixing date. <ul><li>The NDF contract is settled offshore for USD 24,324 (= BRL 90,000 / 3.70).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Forward versus NDF pricing</strong></p><p>While interest rate parity helps explain forward pricing, it is generally less the case for NDFs, which may diverge due to <strong>expected FX regime change</strong>, <strong>speculative positioning</strong>, capital flows, local onshore rate markets and the relationship between offshore and onshore currency forward markets. </p><p>If international investors <strong>cannot access onshore rate markets or deposits in local currency</strong>, NDF prices for the currency are based primarily on <strong>the expected future spot exchange rate</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="FX-Swaps"><a href="#FX-Swaps" class="headerlink" title="FX Swaps"></a>FX Swaps</h2><p>Combines offsetting and simultaneously executed FX spot and forward transactions. In an FX swap, the base currency is purchased (or sold) on a spot basis and sold (or purchased) on a forward basis. </p><ul><li>These are distinct from cross-currency interest rate swaps which involve intermediate cash flows to transform a fixed-income exposure from one currency to another (addressed later). </li><li>A primary use for FX swaps is to replace or “roll” forward transactions as they approach maturity.</li></ul><h2 id="FX-Options"><a href="#FX-Options" class="headerlink" title="FX Options"></a>FX Options</h2><p>Like options in other asset classes, option transactions involve the purchase or sale of the right, but not the obligation to exchange one currency for another at a pre-determined “strike” price on a pre-determined date in the future. </p><ul><li>Many firms hedge the exposure they face for uncertain forecasted transactions in other currencies using options.</li></ul><h2 id="Cross-currency-swaps"><a href="#Cross-currency-swaps" class="headerlink" title="Cross-currency swaps"></a>Cross-currency swaps</h2><h3 id="cross-currency-swaps"><a href="#cross-currency-swaps" class="headerlink" title="cross-currency swaps"></a>cross-currency swaps</h3><p><strong>A series of FX forwards</strong> designed to <strong>convert recurring or periodic cash flows from one currency to another</strong>, or effectively the <strong>exchange of a floating rate note in one currency with that of another</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Example of a JPY investor buying a USD bond:</p><p>| Time | Action                                                       |<br>| —— | —————————————————————————————— |<br>| T=0  | Investor must sell JPY, buy USD at spot to pay for USD bond  |<br>| T=t  | Investor receives USD coupons and must convert at unknown future JPY/USD spot rate |<br>| T=n  | Investor receives final USD coupon and principal and must convert back to JPY at unknown future JPY/USD spot rate |</p></li></ul><h3 id="floating-floating-cross-currency-basis-swap"><a href="#floating-floating-cross-currency-basis-swap" class="headerlink" title="floating-floating cross-currency basis swap"></a>floating-floating cross-currency basis swap</h3><p>involve both initial and final exchange of principal upon inception and maturity at the current spot rate, with a periodic exchange of floating benchmark rates.</p><h3 id="Use-of-cross-currency-swaps"><a href="#Use-of-cross-currency-swaps" class="headerlink" title="Use of cross-currency swaps"></a>Use of cross-currency swaps</h3><ul><li><p>common among investors seeking bringing offshore investments back to their home currency and issuers hedging translation risk or foreign currency debt issuance.</p></li><li><p>Pricing and Interest Rate Parity</p><ul><li>Classical interest rate parity requires that currencies may be invested at risk-free zero-coupon rates, a condition which is not satisfied by instruments based upon swap rates</li></ul></li><li><p>Classical interest rate parity requires that currencies may be invested at risk-free zero-coupon rates, a condition which is not satisfied by instruments based upon swap rates</p></li></ul>]]></content>

We document a number of novel results. </p><ul><li>First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. </li><li>Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: <strong>returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes</strong>. </li><li>Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax returns). </li><li>Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. </li><li>Finally, <strong>wealth returns are correlated across generations</strong>.
