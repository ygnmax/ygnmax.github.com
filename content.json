Managing operational risk is a function of both internal and external processes related to cash and securities and managing client accounts and information. The approach must evolve along with changes in technology, markets and regulation. More traditional monitoring in the form of periodic credit reviews and operational risks associated with transactional banking such as the segregation or safekeeping of client assets or data protection issues are critical risk monitoring functions People Key person risk refers to any institution which relies heavily on one individual,whether that be within senior management or operations Rogue employee or trader risk will always remain a concern despite of enhanced and automated methods of managing monitoring employee activity Processes Procedural breakdowns in processing and managing market and credit risk as well as meeting compliance and regulatory requirements can create competitive disadvantages or result in opportunity cost and/or actual losses It is important to continually review controls and incentives in place, and adapt to a changing market and regulatory environment Systems Errors resulting from outdated systems, lack of systems integration and/or gapswhere human intervention is needed can raise costs and lower efficiency Increasing use of technology, in particular artificial intelligence, robotics processautomation and machine learning techniques to eliminate manual, error prone repetitive processes among banks and financial institutions Where is Operational risk fromMarket Infrastructure Central Securities Depositories (Euroclear, Clearstream) Global Payments Network (Fedwire, CHIPS, etc.) Exchanges and Clearinghouses (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, LCH, etc.) Securities Financing Transactions (Repo) Role of a Global Custodian in Managing Operational Risk Internal Operational Risk Management Identification Assessment Measurement Control and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting CSDShift from Decentralized Physical to Centralized Dematerialized Processing: Until the Paperwork Crisis of 1968 NYSE stock certificates were physically delivered until brokers were overwhelmed by high trade volumes Firms failed and the number of failed trades (if delivery did not occur within five days) soared The NYSE established the Central Certificate Service ( to transfer securities electronically, eliminate physical handling, and track shares held by NYSE members Central Securities Depositories are entities which record legal entitlements todematerialized securities and operate transaction settlement systems in those securities Major CSDs, include DTCC, Euroclear and Clearstream DTCC (Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, formerly CCS) DTCC is owned and directed by its users It automates, standardizes, and streamlines capital markets transactions DTC (Depository Trust Corporation) provides clearance, settlement, and information services for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, government and mortgage backed securities, money market instruments, and over the counter derivatives NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) executes multilateral netting to manage transactions between mutual funds and insurance carriers and their respective investors FICC (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation) provides clearing for fixed income securities, including Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities, including real time trade matching, clearing, risk management, and netting for trades in US government debt issues, including repurchase agreements or repos Euroclear Clearstream Payment NetworksSWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is a cooperative utility messaging system formed in 1973 by over 200 banks headquartered in Belgium. In 1977 it replaced Telex technology with a messaging platform to validate and route standardized messages. Over 11 000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries now use SWIFT. As a secure financial messaging system, SWIFT does not perform funds transfer, clearing or settlement. SWIFT payment orders must be settled by correspondent accounts that institutions have with one other. Fedwire is a real time gross settlement funds transfer system operated by U S Federal Reserve Banks enabling financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between over 9 000 participants. Correspondent Banking Bilateral arrangement, often involving a reciprocal cross border relationship in multiple currencies. A correspondent banking arrangement involves one bank (the correspondent) providing accounts and related services, to another bank (the respondent), often including its affiliates. Exchanges and ClearinghousesSecurities and derivatives exchanges provide a centralized location where securities are listed and traded by a restricted set of brokers who are members of an exchange; recordkeeping is dematerialized and based upon electronic communication networks. Alternative trading venues and systems including dark pools offer private means to conduct securities transactions These venues have faced increased scrutiny and disclosure (under Regulation ATS) given concerns over conflict of interest and other practicesCentral clearinghouses (CCPs) are centralized entities including CME and LCH which mutualize counterparty credit risk in the foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, credit, commodity and weather derivative markets in which they operate CCPs aim to reduce settlement risk via several measures Net offsetting trades between multiple counterparties Require collateral (margin) deposits Provide independent valuation of trades and collateral Monitor creditworthiness of member firms, and Provide a guarantee fund used to cover losses exceeding a defaulting member’s collateral Advantages of central counterparty clearing arrangements are greater risk transparency, lower processing costs, and clear rules in cases of member default Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, they are novated to a clearinghouse which steps between trader clearing firms to assumes legal counterparty risk for the trade (a trade between members A and B become two trades A CCP and CCP B) Disadvantages of central clearing include the concentration of risk which was previously decentralized and distributed in the bilateral OTC model, the interdependency of CCPs, which are now have become crucial financial infrastructures following post crisis reform which forced the over the counter derivatives market into central clearing and the limited capital held by CCPs themselves Securities Financing Transactions (Repo)Global CustodianGlobal custody and fund services providers offer a range of financial services associated with the safekeeping of financial assets including the following: Hold in safekeeping securities such as domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, commodities and cash Facilitate settlement of purchases/sales and deliveries in/out of securities and currency Support asset income collection (regular and special dividends, bond coupons, maturities) and administer related tax withholding documents and foreign tax reclamation Provide corporate action services on securities held such as proxy voting, stock dividends, stock splits, business combinations ( tender offers, bond calls, etc Offer securities lending services Maintain currency cash bank accounts manage cash and perform foreign exchange transactions Perform accounting services such as NAV reporting for mutual funds, accounting services and complex sub accounting services for pension funds Operational challenges outsourced by investors to custodians include the following: Active subcustodian management: Custodians contract with local banks as agents, performing initial and ongoing due diligence on financial strength, custody expertise and capacity, technology, management and infrastructure, ties with local market entities, income and corporate action capabilities, internal/external audit results, contingency plans, insurance coverage and tax expertise Assist in new market expansion Clients considering expansion to a new market tap custody bank expertise on market structure, requirements and regulation When a custodian opens a new market to clients, network market managers work with local market representatives to understand the market and advocate for infrastructure changes to make markets more acceptable to foreign investors Asset segregation and ringfencing: Custodians conduct periodic legal reviews of recoverability of securities held on behalf of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the subcustodian, maintaining omnibus and segregated cash and securities accounts in the name of the bank separate from subcustodian assets where possible Manage Operational RiskFive stepsIdentification Assessment Measurement Control and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Compliance risk: Failure to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, codes of conduct and standards of self regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities of the Firm use the outer communication system (like whatsapp) send restricted data from work desktop to an external domain Conduct risk: Risk that an action (or inaction) by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation. Legal risk: Loss primarily caused by actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm. Estimations and Model Risk: Potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs Cybersecurity risk The Firm devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assetsBusiness and technology resiliency risk: Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, flooding, transit strikes, terrorist threats or infectious disease The safety of employees and customers is the highest priority. The Firm’s global resiliency program is intended to enable the recovery of critical business functions and supporting assets ( technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption Payment fraud risk: Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. Third party outsourcing risk: To identify and manage the operational risk inherent in outsourcing. Quantifying Operating RiskExpected versus Unexpected Loss Basic Indicator Approach Simplest form for banks without significant international operations Banks using the BIA must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage α of positive annual gross income (excluding year where annual gross income is negative or zero): K_{BIA}=\\frac{\\sum GI_{1,2,\\cdots,n}*\\alpha}{n}Standard Approach This methodology used for internationally active institutions divides bank activities into corporate finance, sales trading, retail, commercial banking, payment settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage Gross income serves as a proxy for the scale of the business and operational risk exposure for each segment Capital charges are calculated by multiplying gross income by a β factor which defines the relationship between industry wide operational risk loss experience and gross income K_{\\text{TSA}}=\\frac{\\sum_{\\text{years}1-3}\\max(\\sum_{i=1}^{8}GI_{i}*\\beta_i)}{3}Standardized Approach Beta Factors The beta factors are a fixed percentage, set by the Committee, relating the level of required capital to the level of the gross income for each of the eight business lines as follows: Business Line Beta Factor NI Average Corporate Finance (β1) 18% 20 Sales &amp; Trading (β2) 18% 0 Retail Banking (β3) 12% 20 Commercial Banking (β4) 15% 25 Payment &amp; Settlement (β5) 18% 15 Agency Services (β6) 15% 10 Asset Management (β7) 12% 25 Retail Brokerage (β8) 12% 15 Example: Under BIA, $\\alpha = 15\\%$ K_{BIA}=130*15\\% = 19.5Under SA K_{KSA}=\\frac{\\sum_{\\text{years}1-3}\\max(\\sum_{i=1}^{8}GI_{i}*\\beta_i)}{3} = 18.75Advanced Management Approach (AMA) Operational Risk Mitigation and ControlAppetite Existing Business New Business Build or Buy and Third-Party Risks","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Economics/Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Economics/Finance/Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/Risk-Management/"}],"tags":[{"name":"NYU","slug":"NYU","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/NYU/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Risk-Management/"},{"name":"FRM","slug":"FRM","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/FRM/"}]},{"title":"Parameter Estimation","slug":"Statistics Parameter Estimation","date":"2020-03-12T04:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-13T04:05:24.392Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/03/12/Statistics Parameter Estimation/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/03/12/Statistics Parameter Estimation/","excerpt":"","text":"EstimatorCriterionunbiased For $\\hat{\\theta}$ which is the estimation of $\\theta$, E_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\theta})=\\thetaeffectivenessAssume $\\hat{\\theta_1}$ and $\\hat{\\theta_2}$ are both unbiased estimation, for $\\forall \\theta \\in \\Theta$, D(\\hat{\\theta_1}) \\leq D(\\hat{\\theta_2})then $\\hat{\\theta_1}$ is more effective than $\\hat{\\theta_2}$.

The CVA calculation for a financial exposure is a function of expected exposure (EE), recovery rate (RR), loss given default (LGD), the probability of default (POD) to arrive at an expected loss (EL), and a discount factor to arrive at the present value of expected loss. Steps in the process are as follows: Example:Consider exposure to a borrower who must deliver a zero-coupon government bond with a yield of 5% maturing in four years, assuming a recovery rate of 40% and probability of default per period of 1.25%. Following the steps on our prior slide: Expected Exposure: Recovery: Loss given Default: Probability of Default: Expected Loss PV of Expected Loss: EE Recovery LGD POD POS EL DF PV Credit ScoringCredit scores and ratings are used by lenders in deciding whether to extend credit to a borrower and in determining contract terms Credit scores are used primarily by lenders for small and medium sized enterprises as well as retail customers Credit ratings are used by credit rating agencies in the wholesale market for bonds issued by private and public entities as well as for asset backed securities (ABS) advantageshortcut to avoid risk disadvantagelag indicator Sovereign credit riskKey differences in sovereign credit risk include the protection against bankruptcy, protectionsagainst creditors as well as unique sources of repayment such as the ability to tax Bankruptcy.versus sovereign debt restructuring renegotiation Bankruptcy is typically protected by national law and most defaults are resolved via debt restructuring and/or renegotiation.

Informally this is a Markov process that behaves conditionally on each regime as an affine process with specific parameters. To facilitate our analysis, specific restrictions are imposed on these parameters. The regime switches are driven by a Markov chain. We prove that the joint process of the Markov chain and the conditionally affine part is a process with an affine structure on an enlarged state space, conditionally on the starting state of the Markov chain. Like for affine processes, the characteristic function can be expressed in a set of ordinary differential equations that can sometimes be solved analytically. This result unifies several semi-analytical solutions found in the literature for pricing derivatives of specific regime switching processes on smaller state spaces. It also provides a unifying theory that allows us to introduce regime switching to the pricing of many derivatives within the broad class of affine processes. Examples include European options and term structure derivatives with stochastic volatility and default. Essentially, whenever there is a pricing solution based on an affine process, we can extend this to a regime switching affine process without sacrificing the analytical tractability of the affine process. The value of informational arbitrage11 February 2020 from FShttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00418-3?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundIn the context of a general semimartingale model, we aim at determining how much an investor is willing to pay to learn additional information that allows achieving arbitrage. If such a value exists, we call it the value of informational arbitrage. We are interested in the case where the information yields arbitrage opportunities but not unbounded profits with bounded risk. As in Amendinger et al. (Finance Stoch. 7:29–46, 2003), we rely on an indifference valuation approach and study optimal consumption–investment problems under initial information and arbitrage. We establish some new results on models with additional information and characterise when the value of informational arbitrage is universal. Semimartingale theory of monotone mean–variance portfolio allocation05 March 2020 from MFhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06912We study dynamic optimal portfolio allocation for monotone mean–variance preferences in a general semimartingale model. Armed with new results in this area, we revisit the work of Cui et al. and fully characterize the circumstances under which one can set aside a nonnegative cash flow while simultaneously improving the mean–variance efficiency of the left‐over wealth. The paper analyzes, for the first time, the monotone hull of the Sharpe ratio and highlights its relevance to the problem at hand. Optimal equilibria for time‐inconsistent stopping problems in continuous time06 March 2020 from MFhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07806For an infinite‐horizon continuous‐time optimal stopping problem under nonexponential discounting, we look for an optimal equilibrium, which generates larger values than any other equilibrium does on the entire state space. When the discount function is log sub‐additive and the state process is one‐dimensional, an optimal equilibrium is constructed in a specific form, under appropriate regularity and integrability conditions. Although there may exist other optimal equilibria, we show that they can differ from the constructed one in very limited ways. This leads to a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of optimal equilibria, up to some closedness condition. To illustrate our theoretic results, comprehensive analysis is carried out for three specific stopping problems, concerning asset liquidation and real options valuation. For each one of them, an optimal equilibrium is characterized through an explicit formula. Hedging nontradable risks with transaction costs and price impact12 March 2020 from MFhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00054A risk‐averse agent hedges her exposure to a nontradable risk factor U using a correlated traded asset S and accounts for the impact of her trades on both factors. The effect of the agent’s trades on U is referred to as cross‐impact. By solving the agent’s stochastic control problem, we obtain a closed‐form expression for the optimal strategy when the agent holds a linear position in U. When the exposure to the nontradable risk factor is nonlinear, we provide an approximation to the optimal strategy in closed‐form, and prove that the value function is correctly approximated by this strategy when cross‐impact and risk‐aversion are small. We further prove that when is nonlinear, the approximate optimal strategy can be written in terms of the optimal strategy for a linear exposure with the size of the position changing dynamically according to the exposure’s “Delta” under a particular probability measure. Utility FunctionConsumption in incomplete markets09 March 2020 from FShttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00420-9?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe develop a method to find approximate solutions, and their accuracy, to consumption–investment problems with isoelastic preferences and infinite horizon, in incomplete markets where state variables follow a multivariate diffusion. We construct upper and lower contractions; these are fictitious complete markets in which state variables are fully hedgeable, but their dynamics is distorted. Such contractions yield pointwise upper and lower bounds for both the value function and the optimal consumption of the original incomplete market, and their optimal policies are explicit in typical models. Approximate consumption–investment policies coincide with the optimal one if the market is complete or utility is logarithmic. Shortfall aversion05 March 2020 from MFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mafi.12239?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundShortfall aversion reflects the higher utility loss of spending cuts from a reference than the utility gain from similar spending increases. Inspired by Prospect Theory’s loss aversion and the peak‐end rule, this paper posits a model of utility from spending scaled by past peak spending. In contrast to traditional models, which call for spending rates proportional to wealth, the optimal policy in this model implies a constant spending rate equal to the historical peak when wealth is relatively large. The spending rate increases when wealth reaches a model‐determined multiple of peak spending. In 1926–2015, shortfall‐averse spending is smooth and typically increasing.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Asset-Pricing/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"}]},{"title":"Commodity","slug":"Financial Risk Management Commodity","date":"2020-02-21T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-13T17:36:19.951Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/21/Financial Risk Management Commodity/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/02/21/Financial Risk Management Commodity/","excerpt":"","text":"This notes is based on the class Financial Risk Management of NYU MFE, including basic conceptions. Commodity OverviewCommodity MarketCommodities are basic, standardized goods which are traded and used in commerce, often distinguished between “hard” (natural resources such as metals and energy) and “soft” (crops and livestock) commodities. Commodity producers and consumers (both end users and those who use them in production processes) often manage commodity price risk assisted by banks. Market dynamics for individual commodities are unique and specifically linked to the countries, sectors and/or companies which engage in exploration, extraction, refining or production (referred to as producers) and those who use these goods as inputs in production or are end users (known as consumers) and therefore rely on periodic physical delivery. Producers and consumers often seek to manage exposure to price volatility via standardized future and option contracts traded on commodity exchanges as well as through customized over-the-counter instruments. Investors on the other hand with no direct physical exposure have increased commodity investments due to low (and sometimes negative) correlation with other asset types. Specific commodities such as gold are sought for wealth preservation and inflation protection by investors seeking a safe haven in volatile markets. ParticipantsBanks and Broker-DealersSeveral large global and U.S. money center banks are engaged in commodity markets, largely as exchange members and OTC derivative and derivatives clearing providers, although some leverage specific credit and industry expertise and client relationships to engage in physical market and structuring opportunities involving financing. ExchangesExchanges perform a variety of functions across physical and derivative markets to support producer and consumer activities: Physical markets require a global network of warehouses to store and deliver on contracts. Exchanges neither own nor operate this network, but create an infrastructure to ensure efficient and secure delivery under physical contract terms. Investments in commodities generally embed this ongoing cost of storage (“cost of carry”) for a warehoused commodity. Derivative markets are generally designed to mirror physical trading. Similar to other futures and options exchanges, these offer standardized contracts with pre-specified delivery dates, location and underlying commodity specifications. Unlike trading in a financial asset, futures not offset by an opposite sale or purchase prior to settlement date are physically settled. Example: corn futures This Chicago Board of Trade contract specifies 5,000 bushels (~ 127 metric tons) of #2 yellow corn traded in USD with a minimum tick size of $12.50 with contracts expiring each March, May, July, September and December. PricingBasisBasis is the difference between the cash and futures price for the same commodity: \\text{Basis} = S_0 - F_{0,t}where $S_0$ is the current spot price and $F_{0,t}$ is the current futures price for delivery at time t. The basis may be positive or negative at any given time, and as the time to delivery passes, the futures price will approach the spot price, resulting in a basis of zero (except for minor differences due to transportation and transaction costs). Example: If the current spot price of gold is $\\$1,488.53/t ~ oz$. and the December futures contract is trading at $\\$1,499.50/t ~ oz$., the basis equals $-\\$10.97$, which is $\\$1,488.53 - \\$1,499.50$. SpreadSpread is the price difference between futures on the same commodity for different maturity dates: \\text{Spread} = F_{0,t+k} - F_{0,t}where $F_{0,t}$ is the current futures price for delivery at t (say in 3 months), while $F_{0,t+k}$ is the current futures price for delivery at $t+k$ (say in 6 months). Example: If the wheat futures contract for delivery in 3 months is $\\$3.25$ per bushel, while the 6-month contract is $\\$3.30$ per bushel, the spread is $\\$0.05$. Cost of Carry ModelA simplified way to value a futures contract which assumes futures prices should depend upon the current spot price and the cost of “carrying” or storing (storage, insurance, transportation and financing) the commodity from now until the futures contract matures. In its simplest form, it assumes no transaction costs or margin requirements, no restrictions on short selling and that investors can freely borrow and lend at the same rate of interest*: F_{0,t} = S_0(1+C_{0,t})Where $C_{0,t}$ is the percentage cost required to store (or “carry”) the commodity from now until time t Cash and Carry Arbitrage F_{0,t} > S_0(1+C_{0,t})If the futures contract price exceeds spot plus carry, a trader can borrow, buy the commodity today for cash, sell futures and carry the goods to the futures expiration date. At time t, she delivers the commodity against the futures contract and repays the loan. Reverse Cash and Carry Arbitrage F_{0,t} < S_0(1+C_{0,t})If the spot price plus carry exceeds the futures price, spot plus carry, the trader can sell short a physical asset. The trader purchases a futures contract, which will be used to honor the short sale commitment. Then the trader lends the proceeds at an established rate of interest. At time t, the trader accepts delivery against the futures contract and uses the commodity received to cover the short position. Examples: WTI spot oil is $\\$55$ per barrel, and a trader notes annualized carry is $5\\%$ or $\\$2.75$ for $6$ months. If 6-month WTI futures are $\\$60$, how can the trader earn a riskless profit? Cash and carry arbitrage - futures are overpriced versus spot plus carry ($\\$60 &gt; \\$57.75$) sell $F_{6mo}$ for $\\$60$, buy oil now at $\\$55$ and pay $\\$2.75$ carry earn $\\$2.25$ ($\\$60 - \\$57.75$) If spot gold is $\\$1,450$ /t oz. and the one-year futures contract is at $\\$1,460$ with a $3.5\\%$ carry cost, how can our trader generate an arbitrage return? Reverse cash and carry arbitrage - futures are underpriced versus spot plus carry ($\\$1,460 &lt; \\$1,500.75$), sell gold short in the cash market, lend the proceeds buy the futures contract Take delivery under the futures contract to cover the short gold position and keep $\\$40.75$ or $\\$1,500.75 - \\$1,460$. Spot and Futures relationship Expectations: F_{0,t}=E{[S_{0,t}]}Futures prices are a function of expected spot commodity prices in the future Backwardation: F_{0,t}E[S_{0,t}]Suggests that futures markets are primarily driven by hedgers who hold long positions. For example, grain millers may purchase futures contracts to reduce their price risk. Hedgers pay speculators a premium to assume the price risk. Speculators take short positions to assume this price risk and are rewarded when the futures price declines to match the spot price at maturity.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Economics/Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Economics/Finance/Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/Risk-Management/"}],"tags":[{"name":"NYU","slug":"NYU","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/NYU/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Risk-Management/"},{"name":"FRM","slug":"FRM","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/FRM/"}]},{"title":"Foreign Exchange","slug":"Financial Risk Management Foreign Exchange","date":"2020-02-14T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-18T20:20:42.025Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/14/Financial Risk Management Foreign Exchange/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/02/14/Financial Risk Management Foreign Exchange/","excerpt":"","text":"This notes is based on the class Financial Risk Management of NYU MFE, including basic conceptions. Foreign Exchange OverviewForeign Exchange MarketThe global foreign exchange (FX) market represents the highest trading volume of any financial asset class (over $5 trillion daily) and has been historically dominated by large international banks trading in a decentralized, over-the-counter manner in what is referred to as the interbank market. history: Modern-day foreign exchange trading was established in the early 1970s following the breakdown of the post-World War II Bretton Woods monetary agreement and subsequent shift from fixed to floating exchange rates among major global economies purpose: The ability to exchange currencies is critical in facilitating the cross-border flow of goods, services and financial assets for transactional and investment purposes. scope: total daily FX trading volume exceeded $5 trillion in 2016, is dominated byUSD, EUR and JPY spot and FX swap transactions originated in the UK and US. trends: FX trading has declined slightly in recent years due to reduced capital and goods flows following the 2008 financial crisis, reduced activity from hedge funds and less appetite among banks to warehouse risk due to increased capital requirements. Emerging fintech-driven non-bank players have increased market share and the proportion of algorithmic trading is rising. Why does the foreign exchange market have such a size and scope Increasing global interdependence amid growing cross-border financial and goods flows Increased wealth and risk appetite drives globalization of investment portfolios Continued emerging market growth attracts cross-border capital and goods flows Three primary foreign exchange risk exposure: transaction risk: the original functional currency value of the transaction will change or be recorded at a different value translation risk: Firms face the translation of foreign currency denominated balance sheet and income statement items (revenues and expenses) from a foreign currency into its functional currency. economic risk: impact long-term investment decisions What drives foreign exchange rates?Currency movements are commonly considered as random events more readily explained after the fact than predicted on an ex-ante basis. This would suggest investors are unable to generate alpha while hedgers should only manage FX-based balance sheet and income statement volatility as needed. Foreign Exchange Rate FrameworkMonetary Approach (Purchasing Power Parity)Implies an exchange rate should reflect the relative price of the same basket of goods across currencies, or alternatively that the difference in the rate of change in domestic and foreign currency prices (the inflation differential) should equal the percentage depreciation or appreciation of the exchange rate. PPP is too narrow a measure to be used in isolation given the existence of non-standard baskets of goods, non-traded goods and other differences. Example: undervalued: A Big Mac costs 130 RUB in Russia and US$5.74 in the U.S. This implies a RUB/USD exchange rate of 22.65. The actual exchange rate of 63.84 RUB/USD suggests the RUB is 64.5% undervalued ($\\frac{63.84 – 22.65}{63.84}$). overvalued: A Big Mac costs SFR 6.50 in Switzerland and US$5.74 in the U.S. The implied SFR/USD exchange rate is 1.13. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate of 0.99 SFR/USD suggests the Swiss franc is 14% overvalued ($\\frac{0.99 – 1.13}{0.99}$). Balance of Payments ApproachAddresses the implications of trade and capital flows for FX rates, focusing on current (goods, services, dividends and interest) versus capital account (investment, portfolio flows or loans) changes which net to zero. Although in theory any current account imbalances are financed via the capital account, in practice changes to certain components are more material than others, for example commodity-led economies (AUD or BRL) respond more to those flows, while emerging Asia is more impacted by business cycles. Flows matter, but do not explain FX volatility. Asset Markets ApproachCurrencies are highly responsive to current and future fundamentals as embodied in asset prices reflecting the present value of future cash flows denominated in different currencies. Under this explanation, FX prices adjust instantaneously to new information about currency fundamentals. This approach is supported by strong empirical evidence and forms the basis for trading. Central bank FX market interventionThis is an additional overlay, particularly in emerging markets driven by an aim to either address an imbalance, offset volatility or accumulate FX reserves. Foreign Exchange ConventionInverse and direct quotingInverse quotesSeveral major (and a few minor) currencies are quoted as the number of U.S. dollars required to purchase one unit of currency. EUR / USD = 1.11 Therefore a stronger EUR will result in a higher EUR/USD, similar to a stock GBP / USD AUD / USD NZD / USD Direct quotesFor all other currencies, prices are quoted as the number of units of foreign currency which buys one US dollar USD / JPY = 107.8 This figure rises as JPY weakens and the USD strengthens Foreign Exchange ToolsSpot and ForwardSpotSpot FX mechanicsSpot transactions are cash transactions usually settled on the second businessday (T+2) after the trade date (CAD, TRY, MXN and RUB settle next day) under an agreement between two parties (one of whom is often a bank) to purchase or sell units of a base currency. Example: A EUR/USD quote of 1.1526 [1.15 representing the ‘big figure’, and the 26 expressed as ‘pips’) means a counterparty purchases one EUR in exchange for $1.1526 dollars. Spot trade exposure is referred to as settlement risk, which arises when one party transfers funds in one currency in anticipation of receiving payment in another currency from another party. Spot comprises less than half of overall FX volume, as market participants usually manage forecasted transaction risks using FX derivatives. ForwardThese involve the exchange of one currency for another at a pre-agreed rate on a pre-determined date ranging from T+3 to several weeks or years. This is the formula: F = S_0 \\frac{(1+y_{US})^T}{(1+y_{FC})^T}In continuous time: F_t = S_0e^{(r-r_f)t} Example: Assume the spot EUR/USD FX rate is 1.10 (i.e., US$ 1.10 buys one euro). If the EUR one year benchmark rate is -0.4% and an equivalent USD one-year benchmark is 2.00%, solve for the one year EUR / USD forward rate. 1.10 \\times\\frac{1+0.02}{1-0.004}=1.1265Note that the higher the interest rate in USD in this case, the more expensive it is to purchase EUR in one year’s time given that the buyer foregoes one year of the higher USD interest. Forward Contract mechanicsForeign exchange forward transactions are quoted in ‘points’, or the (positive or negative) difference in the forward and spot quote scaled to the last decimal in the corresponding spot quote. Example: the one-year forward rate of +265 points would apply to EUR/USD in our above example, the corresponding forward rate being 1.10 + (265/10,000) = 1.1265. Many firms hedge transaction exposure for relatively certain forecasted transactions such as accounts receivable or payable as well as investment exposures using currency forward transactions. Non-deliverable FX forwards, swaps and options Exchange Rate Restrictions Although freely floating currencies are predominant among major industrial nations, only around 30 global currencies are freely floating, with others (mostly emerging markets (EM) currencies) subject to controls such as restrictions on trading or exchanging currencies. Non-Deliverable FX Forwards (NDFs)These are similar to standard forward agreements in that they involve the exchange of one currency’s value for another at a pre-agreed rate on a pre-determined date. However, given onshore currency restrictions, they are settled in a convertible currency (usually USD) offshore without a physical exchange of the hedged currency. Example: A corporation enters into a $1 million NDF to purchase BRL and sell USD for settlement in one month at a forward rate of 3.79 BRL/USD. In one month, the NDF breaks even if USD 1,000,000 = BRL 3,790,000. If BRL strengthens to 3.70 instead, the BRL buyer has a gain of BRL 90,000 on the fixing date. The NDF contract is settled offshore for USD 24,324 (= BRL 90,000 / 3.70). Forward versus NDF pricing While interest rate parity helps explain forward pricing, it is generally less the case for NDFs, which may diverge due to expected FX regime change, speculative positioning, capital flows, local onshore rate markets and the relationship between offshore and onshore currency forward markets. If international investors cannot access onshore rate markets or deposits in local currency, NDF prices for the currency are based primarily on the expected future spot exchange rate. FX SwapsCombines offsetting and simultaneously executed FX spot and forward transactions. In an FX swap, the base currency is purchased (or sold) on a spot basis and sold (or purchased) on a forward basis. These are distinct from cross-currency interest rate swaps which involve intermediate cash flows to transform a fixed-income exposure from one currency to another (addressed later). A primary use for FX swaps is to replace or “roll” forward transactions as they approach maturity. FX OptionsLike options in other asset classes, option transactions involve the purchase or sale of the right, but not the obligation to exchange one currency for another at a pre-determined “strike” price on a pre-determined date in the future. Many firms hedge the exposure they face for uncertain forecasted transactions in other currencies using options. Cross-currency swapscross-currency swapsA series of FX forwards designed to convert recurring or periodic cash flows from one currency to another, or effectively the exchange of a floating rate note in one currency with that of another. Example of a JPY investor buying a USD bond: | Time | Action || —— | —————————————————————————————— || T=0 | Investor must sell JPY, buy USD at spot to pay for USD bond || T=t | Investor receives USD coupons and must convert at unknown future JPY/USD spot rate || T=n | Investor receives final USD coupon and principal and must convert back to JPY at unknown future JPY/USD spot rate | floating-floating cross-currency basis swapinvolve both initial and final exchange of principal upon inception and maturity at the current spot rate, with a periodic exchange of floating benchmark rates. Use of cross-currency swaps common among investors seeking bringing offshore investments back to their home currency and issuers hedging translation risk or foreign currency debt issuance. Pricing and Interest Rate Parity Classical interest rate parity requires that currencies may be invested at risk-free zero-coupon rates, a condition which is not satisfied by instruments based upon swap rates Classical interest rate parity requires that currencies may be invested at risk-free zero-coupon rates, a condition which is not satisfied by instruments based upon swap rates","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Economics/Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Economics/Finance/Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/Risk-Management/"}],"tags":[{"name":"NYU","slug":"NYU","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/NYU/"},{"name":"Risk Management","slug":"Risk-Management","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Risk-Management/"},{"name":"FRM","slug":"FRM","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/FRM/"}]},{"title":"Economic Inequality Papers","slug":"Summary of Economic Inequality Papers","date":"2020-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-01T01:42:35.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/10/Summary of Economic Inequality Papers/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/02/10/Summary of Economic Inequality Papers/","excerpt":"","text":"Heterogeneity and Persistence in Returns to WealthJuly 2018https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18171.ashxWe provide a systematic analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth using 12 years of population data from Norway’s administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate. Genetic Endowments and Wealth Inequality29 Feb 2020 from JPEhttp://www.nber.org/papers/w24642.pdfWe show that genetic endowments linked to educational attainment strongly and robustly predict wealth at retirement. The estimated relationship is not fully explained by flexibly controlling for education and labor income. We therefore investigate a host of additional mechanisms that could account for the gene-wealth gradient, including inheritances, mortality, risk preferences, portfolio decisions, beliefs about the probabilities of macroeconomic events, and planning horizons. We provide evidence that genetic endowments related to human capital accumulation are associated with wealth not only through educational attainment and labor income but also through a facility with complex financial decision-making.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Inequality","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Inequality","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Inequality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Inequality","slug":"Inequality","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Inequality/"}]},{"title":"Machine Learning Overview","slug":"ML Overview","date":"2020-02-08T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-17T14:39:07.918Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/08/ML Overview/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/02/08/ML Overview/","excerpt":"","text":"This notes is based on the class Machine Learning in Finance of NYU MFE, including basic knowledge of supervised learning.

The issuer and underwriter then compare and adjust this four year yield spread based upon recent five year issues for companies with similar ratings and/or in the same industry for a proposed spread for the new issuance. Credit spreads Benchmark spread is the spread over the most recently issued government bond of similar maturity G-spread is the spread over actual or interpolated government bond with matched maturity I-spread is the spread over swap rates that match the credit security’s tenor and currency Z-spread is the zero volatility spread measured across each point along the implied spot yield curve Option adjusted spread (OAS) is a generalized Z spread and often most appropriate for portfolios Current yieldCurrent yield is sometimes called the income or interest yield and is the sum of coupon paymentsreceived over the year divided by the flat price. For example, a 10 year, 2 semiannual coupon payment bond is priced at 95 per 100 of par value Its current yield is $\\frac{2}{95} = 2.105%$. This crude measure neglects coupon payment frequency in the numerator and accrued interest in the denominator Structure of Interest ratesyield curvedefinitionThe yield curve on coupon bonds is a snapshot of rates for non-callable securities with similar risk profile across maturities. Yield curves generally have a positive slope given the higher risk of holding longer-term securities Investors typically demand a higher premium to lend for longer The change in price for a given change in yield is higher for longer duration securities Yield curve shape is dynamic, and the term structure is influenced by various factors Short-term policy rates such as U.S. Federal Funds tend to drive short-term yields Long-term Treasury yields are more affected by long-term inflation and growth expectations U.S. Federal Funds have an impact on long-term yield by adjusting short-term yields Term structure theories are driven by expectations, segmentation and liquidity preference Expectations theories rely solely on investor / issuer expectations of future short-term rates Segmented market theory implies that investors / issuers have limited maturity selection Liquidity preference theory combines risk and return as critical factors for issuers / investors shapes - tool to forecast economic activity A positively sloped curve is generally associated with a future increase in real economic activity Curve flattening or inversion where short term yields exceed long term yields portends a drop in short term rates and an expected decline in GDP Influence Factors: Monetary policy (tightening tends to slow the economy and flatten (or invert) the curve) Investor expectations of future short-term rates as influenced by both credit demand and expected inflation General financial market conditions spot curvesZero curves represent one cash flow on a pre-determined date. One example is for zero-coupon government bonds across maturities. This government bond spot curve (or zero or “strip” curve as individual coupons are “stripped” off of coupon bonds) is a set of yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds. While often referred to as “risk-free” yields, this only refers to relative default risk, not inflation or liquidity risk. par curvesPar curves represent par value bonds maturing on pre-determined dates. In addition to the yield curve on coupon bonds and the spot curve on zero-coupon bonds, maturity structure can be assessed using a par curve. A par curve is a sequence of yields-to-maturity such that each bond is priced at par value. The bonds have the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and annual yields stated for the same periodicity forward curvesForward curves are a series of forward (future delivery) rates derived from spot rates. Implied forward rates (also known as forward yields) are calculated from spot rates as a break-even reinvestment rate linking return on investment in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to that of a longer-term zero-coupon bond. Example: There are two alternative loans: A is for 1 year at 2%; B is for 2 Years at 3%. Then $F_{1,1}$ is the one-year rate a year from now which equates 102 at year 1 to 106 at year 2: r = \\frac{106}{102}-1 = 3.9216\\%which means 102 \\times 1.039216 = 106The implied forward rate may be checked by investing 102 for 1 year at this rate. This is also the basic principle of forward rate agreement(FRA): (1 + Z_A)^A \\times(1+IFR_{A,B-A})^{B-A}=(1+Z_B)^BA is the shorter term bond in A periods. B is longer term bond in B periods. Source of bond riskThe market value sensitivity of a bond (or other rate sensitive instrument) to interest rate changes isbased on the bond valuation formula shown below based upon the full (or “dirty”) price MV = \\frac{PMT}{(1+y)^{1-\\frac{t}{T}}} + \\frac{PMT}{(1+y)^{2-\\frac{t}{T}}}+ ... +\\frac{PMT}{(1+y)^{N-\\frac{t}{T}}}where MV is the full price, PMT is the coupon, FV is principal, y is yield per period and the bond settles t days into the T day period with N periods to maturity. It can be expanded as: dMV = (\\frac{\\partial MV}{\\partial y}\\times dy)+(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 MV}{\\partial y^2}\\times dy^2)The first expression is a duration and the second term is a convexity, which are often shown divided by 100 on Bloomberg. DurationMacaulay durationmeasures the sensitivity of the bond’s full price (including accrued interest) to changes in the bond’s yield to maturity or, more generally, to changes in benchmark interest rates. It assumes variables other than yield or benchmark rates (including time to maturity) are unchanged: \\text{Macaulay Duration} = -\\frac{\\partial \\text{MV}}{\\partial y}\\times\\frac{1+y}{MV}=-\\frac{\\frac{\\partial \\text{MV}}{MV}}{\\frac{\\partial y}{1+y}}Duration measures instantaneous (or same day) bond price changes and may be considered aweighted average (the share of full price corresponding to each cash flow) of the time to receipt ofpromised cash flows. Using an annual coupon example on a coupon date, we can simplify \\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{(\\text{PV of CF})\\times t}{PV^{full}}Example: For a 6% annual coupon 5 year bond with 5% yield to maturity, the price is: \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 104.329477,~ ~ r=5\\% Period Cash Flow Present Value Weight Period $\\times$ Weight 1 6 $\\frac{6}{(1+5\\%)^1}=5.714$ $\\frac{5.714}{104.329}=0.0548$ 0.055 2 6 $\\frac{6}{(1+5\\%)^2}=5.442$ $\\frac{5.442}{104.329}=0.0522$ 0.104 3 6 $\\frac{6}{(1+5\\%)^3}=5.183$ $\\frac{5.183}{104.329}=0.0497$ 0.149 4 6 $\\frac{6}{(1+5\\%)^4}=4.936$ $\\frac{4.936}{104.329}=0.0473$ 0.189 5 106 $\\frac{106}{(1+5\\%)^5}=83.054$ $\\frac{83.054}{104.329}=0.7961$ 3.981 104.329 Duration 4.478 Modified durationModified duration is a minor adjustment to Macaulay duration (dividing by 1 + yield per period) and isdirectly related to the percentage change in a bond’s market value: \\text{Modified Duration} = -\\frac{\\text{Macaulay Duration}}{(1+\\frac{r}{c})}This is a linear estimate of a fixed-rate bond’s price change for a given yield to maturity change: \\%\\Delta PV = -\\text{Modified Duration} \\times\\Delta\\text{Yield}Example: How does the bond price in the prior example (6% annual 5 yr coupon bond with a 5% yield to maturity) change if yields decline 100 bps? Given a Macaulay Duration of 4.478, the Modified Duration is $\\frac{4.478}{1.05}=4.265$. Therefore, -4.265 \\times (-100bps) \\times \\%= 4.265\\%there will be 4.2645% price appreciation. The error: For original bond price: \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 104.329477,~ ~ r=5\\%For the new price estimate: 104.329477 \\times (1 + 4.2645\\%) = 108.77863For the Actual new bond price: \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 108.903645,~ ~ r=4\\%There are $108.90365 - 108.77863 = -.125$ difference in price explained by the non-linearity of the price-yield relationship. Effective DurationEffective Duration is the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a change in a benchmark yield curve such as a government par curve, similar to approximate modified duration except it involves a benchmark and also may be used for more complex bonds or portfolios of complex bonds \\text{Effective Duration} = \\frac{PV_{-}-PV_{+}}{2\\times(\\Delta\\text{Curve})(PV_0)}Money Duration (Dollar Duration)Dollar Duration is the price change for a given change in yield in units of the currency in which the bond is denominated (as opposed to a percentage change) stated per 100 of par or based upon an actualportfolio position (known as “dollar duration in the U.S.) \\text{Dollar Duration} = -\\frac{\\part MV}{\\part y}=\\text{Modified Duration}\\times MV \\Delta PV = -\\text{Dollar Duration} \\times\\Delta\\text{Yield}A related statistic is the present value of a basis point: \\text{PV of a Basis Point} = \\frac{PV_{-} - PV_{+}}{2}This is the dollar value (DV01) or present value of a basis point (PV01), which is calculated by increasing and decreasing the yield by 1 bp to get the price change. Portfolio DurationPortfolio duration is the sum of market value weighted durations of component positions. Positive is a long position and negative is a short position Practitioners use duration and DV 01 PVBP statistics to analyze cash and synthetic positions to gauge net exposure, profitability and/or evaluate trade ideas Example: A bond trader holds two 2 year U.S. Treasury notes and one 30 year U S Treasury bond. Each bond has a face value of $1000000 with 2 year duration of 1.94 and the 30 year duration of 19.69. Portfolio duration is $7.86 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1.94 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 19.69$ Portfolio DV01 equals $7.86 \\times \\frac{\\$3000000}{10 000} = \\$2358$ If 2 year and 30 year yields rise 10 bps, her portfolio LOSS $\\$23580 = \\$2358 \\times 10 bps$ Coupon: For zero-coupon bonds, duration = maturity. As Coupons increase, duration decrease. Maturity: increase as maturity increase. Time: As maturity decrease to 0, time goes down Yield: As yields increase, duration decrease. ConvexityWhile modified duration is a linear approximation of price changes for a given change in yield, the true price/yield relationship is a convexity adjusted equation expressed as follows: \\%\\Delta PV = -\\text{Modified Duration} \\times\\Delta\\text{Yield} + \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\text{Convexity}\\times(\\Delta Yield)^2The second convexity term is positive for traditional (option free) fixed rate bond for a yield increase or decrease. Convexity may be calculated with tables, precisely derived or closely approximated: \\text{Convexity} = \\frac{PV_-+PV_+}{(\\Delta \\text{yield})^2\\times PV_0}Example: Calculate the change in full bond price from the prior example (6% annual 5 yr coupon bond with a 5% yield to maturity) given a 100 bp yield decline with the convexity adjustment? At a yield of $5\\%$, the bond price was $104.329477$ and the Modified Duration is $4.264525$, so \\%\\Delta \\text{PV}=-4.264525 \\times\\Delta\\text{Yield} = 4.2645\\%The approximate convexity with the bond price at 4.99%, 5.00%, 5.01% ($\\Delta \\text{Yeild}=0.0001$) as follows: \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 104.3739805,~ ~ r=4.99\\% \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 104.3294767,~ ~ r=5\\% \\frac{6}{(1+r)^1}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^2}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^3}+\\frac{6}{(1+r)^4}+\\frac{106}{(1+r)^5} = 104.2849973,~ ~ r=5.01\\%According to the formula: \\begin{eqnarray*} \\text{ApproxCon} &=& \\frac{\\text{PV}_{-}+\\text{PV}_{+}-2\\text{PV}_{0}}{(\\Delta \\text{Yield})^2 \\times \\text{PV}_{0}} \\\\ &=&\\frac{104.3739805 + 104.2849973 -2\\times104.3294767}{0.0001^2\\times104.3294767} \\\\ &=& 23.444 \\end{eqnarray*}Therefore, the full price change percent is: \\begin{eqnarray*} \\%\\Delta\\text{PV} &\\approx& -4.264525 \\times 0.01 + \\frac{1}{2}\\times23.444\\times0.01^2 \\\\ &\\approx& 0.043817455 \\end{eqnarray*}the convexity-adjusted price increase given -1% in yield is $4.3817455\\%$, which is a $0.0026%$ difference compared to the actual price increase. Bond Portfolio RiskBond Portfolio Duration and ConvexityDuration is the primary measure of price risk arising from a change in the yield to maturity. It is most important over short time horizons where investor focus is on price as opposed to coupon reinvestment risk. Duration is also referred to as repricing risk, and it is important to note that variable rate instruments with longer maturities have short duration dictated by the timing of that repricing (such as 3 month LIBOR) Convexity represents a secondary measure of price risk Investors may benefit from positive convexity, for example, a 100 year or century bond will exhibit much higher convexity than a 30 year bond despite similar duration, resulting in a larger gain amid declining interest rates. Callable bond investors expect to be compensated for the uncertainty related to final maturity which these bonds exhibit in terms of negative convexity (i e bond price appreciation amid falling rates is effectively capped by the call feature) Portfolio Duration and ConvexityDuration for a fixed income bond portfolio may be calculated in two ways: Weight the average time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows (which is theoretically correct but difficult to put into practice) Weight the average of individual bond durations within the portfolio \\text{MV}=\\frac{CF_1}{(1+\\text{Yield of Portfolio})^1}+\\frac{CF_2}{(1+\\text{Yield of Portfolio})^2}+...+\\frac{CF_N}{(1+\\text{Yield of Portfolio})^N}Theoretically, the formula above should be based upon a homogenous non-callable bond portfolio where the full and flat price are equal, but in practice, the weighted averages are used: \\begin{eqnarray*} \\text{AvgMacDur of Portfolio} &=& \\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\text{MacDur}_j\\times\\left(\\frac{\\text{MV}_{j}}{\\text{MV}}\\right) \\\\ \\text{AvgModDur of Portfolio} &=& \\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\text{ModDur}_j\\times\\left(\\frac{\\text{MV}_{j}}{\\text{MV}}\\right) \\\\ \\text{AvgConvexity of Portfolio} &=& \\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\text{Convexity}_j\\times\\left(\\frac{\\text{MV}_{j}}{\\text{MV}}\\right) \\end{eqnarray*}Source of Bond YTM ChangesYield changes may originate in either benchmark or spread changes or a combination of the twocomponents. Credit spread example: A risk manager is tasked with weighing the relative risk of two spread positions under a recession scenarioBond 1 has modified duration of 3.00 and a convexity of 24.00 and is expected to face 25 bps of spreadwidening, and Bond 2 has modified duration of 5.00 and a convexity of 40.00 and is expected to seespreads widen by 15 bps in a downturn. Which bond has more price risk? Bond 2 has slightly more risk: \\% \\Delta \\text{PV}_\\text{Full} \\approx (-3\\times0.0025) + \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\times24\\times(0.0025)^2\\right] \\approx-0.007425 \\\\ \\% \\Delta \\text{PV}_\\text{Full} \\approx (-5\\times0.0015) + \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\times40\\times(0.0015)^2\\right] \\approx-0.007455Liquidity example: A trader’s boss wants her to gauge the precise bid offer cost of liquidating a thinly traded corporate bondposition The face value is $\\$120 000 000$ with a modified duration of 4.5 and convexity of 35 and the bidoffer cost is expected to be 5 bps What is the estimated cost of trading the position?

The framework uses the Black‐Merton‐Scholes option pricing formula to attribute the short‐term option investment risk to variation in the underlying security price and the option’s implied volatility.Taking risk‐neutral expectation and demanding no dynamic arbitrage results in a pricing relation that links an option’s fair implied volatility level to the underlying’s volatility level with corrections for the implied volatility’s own expected direction of movement, its variance, and its covariance with the underlying security return. Static and semistatic hedging as contrarian or conformist bets12 March 2020 From MFhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02854In this paper, we argue that, once the costs of maintaining the hedging portfolio are properly taken into account, semistatic portfolios should more properly be thought of as separate classes of derivatives, with nontrivial, model‐dependent payoff structures. We derive new integral representations for payoffs of exotic European options in terms of payoffs of vanillas, different from the Carr–Madan representation, and suggest approximations of the idealized static hedging/replicating portfolio using vanillas available in the market. We study the dependence of the hedging error on a model used for pricing and show that the variance of the hedging errors of static hedging portfolios can be sizably larger than the errors of variance‐minimizing portfolios. We explain why the exact semistatic hedging of barrier options is impossible for processes with jumps, and derive general formulas for variance‐minimizing semistatic portfolios. We show that hedging using vanillas only leads to larger errors than hedging using vanillas and first touch digitals. In all cases, efficient calculations of the weights of the hedging portfolios are in the dual space using new efficient numerical methods for calculation of the Wiener–Hopf factors and Laplace–Fourier inversion. Real-Option Valuation in Multiple Dimensions Using Poisson Optional Stopping Times28 January 2020 from JFQAhttp://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/94a1/56cdc6359a0c90061bb678fa9ef32ed5be6c.pdfWe provide a new framework for valuing multidimensional real options where opportunities to exercise the option are generated by an exogenous Poisson process, which can be viewed as a liquidity constraint on decision times. This approach, which we call the Poisson optional stopping times (POST) method, finds the value function as a monotone sequence of lower bounds. In a case study, we demonstrate that the frequently used quasi-analytic method yields a suboptimal policy and an inaccurate value function. The proposed method is demonstrably correct, straightforward to implement, reliable in computation, and broadly applicable in analyzing multidimensional option-valuation problems. CreditRuin probabilities for a Lévy-driven generalised Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process04 December 2019 from FShttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-019-00413-3?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound We study the asymptotics of the ruin probability for a process which is the solution of a linear SDE defined by a pair of independent Lévy processes. Our main interest is a model describing the evolution of the capital reserve of an insurance company selling annuities and investing in a risky asset. Let $\\beta &gt; 0$ be the root of the cumulant-generating function ${H}$ of the increment $V_1$ of the log-price process. We show that the ruin probability admits the exact asymptotic $Cu^{-\\beta}$ as the initial capital $u \\to \\infty$, assuming only that the law of $V_{T}$ is non-arithmetic without any further assumptions on the price process. Is the Credit Spread Puzzle a Myth?20 February 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300428?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe revisit Feldhütter and Schaefer (FS, 2018), who report evidence of a “credit spread puzzle” for high-yield but not investment-grade bonds. We show their results are reversed when their model is calibrated to market values of debt (as required by theory) rather than book values.We then demonstrate that using credit spreads rather than historical default rates to identify the default boundary provides the statistical power necessary to reject their assumption that firm dynamics follow geometric Brownian motion. A large market price of jump risk is required to match historical default rates, which generates a credit spread puzzle for investment-grade but not high-yield bonds. Robust XVA12 March 2020 from MFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mafi.12260?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe introduce an arbitrage‐free framework for robust valuation adjustments. An investor trades a credit default swap portfolio with a risky counterparty, and hedges credit risk by taking a position in defaultable bonds. The investor does not know the exact return rate of her counterparty’s bond, but she knows it lies within an uncertainty interval. We derive both upper and lower bounds for the XVA process of the portfolio, and show that these bounds may be recovered as solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The presence of collateralization and closeout payoffs leads to important differences with respect to classical credit risk valuation. The value of the super‐replicating portfolio cannot be directly obtained by plugging one of the extremes of the uncertainty interval in the valuation equation, but rather depends on the relation between the XVA replicating portfolio and the closeout value throughout the life of the transaction. Our comparative statics analysis indicates that credit contagion has a nonlinear effect on the replication strategies and on the XVA.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Asset-Pricing/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"}]},{"title":"Asset Pricing - Fixed Income","slug":"Summary of Asset Pricing Fixed Income","date":"2020-01-30T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-15T16:03:37.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/30/Summary of Asset Pricing Fixed Income/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/30/Summary of Asset Pricing Fixed Income/","excerpt":"","text":"TheoryAn incomplete equilibrium with a stochastic annuity29 January 2020 from FShttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00415-6?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe prove the global existence of an incomplete, continuous-time finite-agent Radner equilibrium in which exponential agents optimise their expected utility over both running consumption and terminal wealth. The market consists of a traded annuity, and along with unspanned income, the market is incomplete. Set in a Brownian framework, the income is driven by a multidimensional diffusion and in particular includes mean-reverting dynamics. The equilibrium is characterised by a system of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations, a solution to which is proved to exist under Markovian assumptions. We also show that the equilibrium allocations lead to Pareto-optimal allocations only in exceptional situations. Term structure modelling for multiple curves with stochastic discontinuities15 February 2020 from FShttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00416-5?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe develop a general term structure framework taking stochastic discontinuities explicitly into account. Stochastic discontinuities are a key feature in interest rate markets, as for example the jumps of the term structures in correspondence to monetary policy meetings of the ECB show. We provide a general analysis of multiple curve markets under minimal assumptions in an extended HJM framework and provide a fundamental theorem of asset pricing based on NAFLVR. The approach with stochastic discontinuities permits to embed market models directly, unifying seemingly different modelling philosophies. We also develop a tractable class of models, based on affine semimartingales, going beyond the requirement of stochastic continuity. Yield Spreads and the Corporate Bond Rollover Channel*13 March 2020 from FShttps://academic.oup.com/rof/article/24/2/345/5364026?rss=1&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundI show that the pricing of a bond liquidity shock depends on the current size of a firm’s bond rollover exposure. Using US corporate bond transactions data, I find that a market liquidity shock induces a larger yield spread increase among firms with nonzero rollover exposures. This effect is more pronounced for credit risky firms and increases in the size of the rollover exposure. Furthermore, I show that tests that do not control for the heterogeneity in firms’ rollover exposure policies provide biased estimates of the pricing impact of the rollover channel.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Asset-Pricing/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Fixed Income","slug":"Fixed-Income","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Fixed-Income/"}]},{"title":"Python Regular Expression Basics","slug":"Python Regular Expression Basics","date":"2020-01-29T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-01-29T20:54:47.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/29/Python Regular Expression Basics/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/29/Python Regular Expression Basics/","excerpt":"","text":"Regular Expression Quick Link12345678910111213141516^ Matches the beginning of a line$ Matches the end of the line.

We model innovation and diffusion as a process involving the combination of new ideas with insights from other industries or countries. We provide conditions under which each country’s equilibrium frontier of knowledge converges to a Fréchet distribution, and derive a system of differential equations describing the evolution of the scale parameters of these distributions, that is, countries’ stocks of knowledge. The model remains tractable with many asymmetric countries and generates a rich set of predictions about how the level and composition of trade affect countries’ frontiers of knowledge. We use the framework to quantify the contribution of bilateral trade costs to long‐run changes in TFP and individual post‐war growth miracles. For our preferred calibration, we find that both gains from trade and the fraction of variation of TFP growth accounted for by changes in trade more than double relative to a model without diffusion. Environmental EconomicsPricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Changehttps://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/3/1024/5735312?rss=1&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundGeophysicists examine and document the repercussions for the earth’s climate induced by alternative emission scenarios and model specifications. Using simplified approximations, they produce tractable characterizations of the associated uncertainty. Meanwhile, economists write highly stylized damage functions to speculate about how climate change alters macroeconomic and growth opportunities. How can we assess both climate and emissions impacts, as well as uncertainty in the broadest sense, in social decision-making? We provide a framework for answering this question by embracing recent decision theory and tools from asset pricing, and we apply this structure with its interacting components to a revealing quantitative illustration.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Macroeconomics","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Macroeconomics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Macroeconomics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Macroeconomics","slug":"Macroeconomics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Macroeconomics/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Economic Growth","slug":"Economic-Growth","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Economic-Growth/"}]},{"title":"Behavioral Asset Pricing Papers","slug":"Summary of Asset Pricing Behavioral Finance","date":"2020-01-28T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-15T16:13:44.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/28/Summary of Asset Pricing Behavioral Finance/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/28/Summary of Asset Pricing Behavioral Finance/","excerpt":"","text":"Empirical Behavioral Asset PricingGoogling Investor Sentiment around the World28 January 2020 from JFQAhttp://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d881/c405d186d0f15c22c258555f024f03401cf7.pdfWe study how investor sentiment affects stock prices around the world. Relying on households’ Google search behavior, we construct a weekly measure of sentiment for 38 countries during 2004–2014.

Security analysts and capital market anomalies28 January 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300192?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe examine the value and efficiency of analyst recommendations through the lens of capital market anomalies. We find that analysts do not fully use the information in anomaly signals when making recommendations. Analysts tend to give more favorable consensus recommendations to stocks classified as overvalued and, more important, these stocks subsequently tend to have particularly negative abnormal returns. Analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with anomaly signals are more skilled and elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns. Our findings suggest that analysts’ biased recommendations could be a source of market friction that impedes the efficient correction of mispricing. Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns02 Febuary 2020 from JFhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300362?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundExisting research has found cross-sectional seasonality of stock returns—the periodic outperformance of certain stocks during the same calendar months or weekdays. We hypothesize that assets’ different sensitivities to investor mood explain these effects and imply other seasonalities. Consistent with our hypotheses, relative performance across individual stocks or portfolios during past high or low mood months and weekdays tends to recur in periods with congruent mood and reverse in periods with noncongruent mood. Furthermore, assets with higher sensitivities to aggregate mood—higher mood betas—subsequently earn higher returns during ascending mood periods and earn lower returns during descending mood periods. Heterogeneous Beliefs and Return Volatility Around Seasoned Equity Offerings09 March 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300623?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe investigate the dynamics of heterogeneous beliefs and link them to the volatility pattern throughout the seasoned equity offering (SEO) event window. In sync with a reduction in information asymmetry related to management information releases around the SEO event, belief heterogeneity declines. Moreover, heterogeneity in beliefs, proxied by either analyst- or institutional-trade-based measures, is a robust and salient determinant of SEO firm volatility, which provides an explanation for the volatility timing “puzzle” identified in the SEO market. Furthermore, the relation between heterogeneous beliefs and return volatility weakens as short sale constraints tighten, suggesting a potential causal link. QuestionireFinancial Loss Aversion Illusion*14 March 2020 from RFhttps://academic.oup.com/rof/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/rof/rfz002/31517466/rfz002.pdfWe test the proposition that investors’ ability to cope with financial losses is much better than they expect. In a panel survey of investors from a large bank in the UK, we ask for their subjective ratings of anticipated returns and experienced returns. The time period covered by the panel (2008–10) is one where investors experienced frequent losses and gains in their portfolios. This period offers a unique setting to evaluate investors’ hedonic experiences. We examine how the subjective ratings behave relative to expected portfolio returns and experienced portfolio returns. Loss aversion is strong for anticipated outcomes; investors are twice as sensitive to negative expected returns as to positive expected returns. However, when evaluating experienced returns, the effect diminishes by more than half and is well below commonly found loss aversion coefficients. This suggests that a large part of investors’ financial loss aversion results from an affective forecasting error.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Behavioral Finance","slug":"Behavioral-Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Behavioral-Finance/"}]},{"title":"Monetary and Bank Papers","slug":"Summary of Macroeconomics Monetary Papers","date":"2020-01-28T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-15T16:15:32.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/28/Summary of Macroeconomics Monetary Papers/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/28/Summary of Macroeconomics Monetary Papers/","excerpt":"","text":"Monetary PolicyOptimal Monetary Policy with Informational Frictions28 January 2020 from JPEhttps://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/66950/1/Marios1122.pdfWe study optimal policy in a business-cycle setting in which firms hold dispersed private information about, or are rationally inattentive to, the state of the economy. The informational friction is the source of both nominal and real rigidity. Because of the latter, the optimal monetary policy does not target price stability. Instead, it targets a negative relation between the nominal price level and real economic activity. Such leaning against the wind helps maximize production efficiency. An additional contribution is the adaptation of the primal approach of the Ramsey literature to a flexible form of informational friction. Banks’ Balance Sheets and Liquidation Values: Evidence from Real Estate Collateral17 June 2019 from RFShttps://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/2/504/5512487?rss=1&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundThis paper finds that declining bank equity or liquidity reduces liquidation values of bank-owned real estate and accelerates the pace of asset sales. Buyers of these assets earn significant returns for providing liquidity to banks, as prices tend to rebound sharply after sales by illiquid banks. Lower liquidation values also depress the prices of nearby real estate transactions. Policy interventions, such as equity injections and central bank asset purchases, increase liquidation values by providing institutions with the balance sheet capacity to slow asset sales. This evidence suggests that balance sheet adjustments at financial institutions can explain real asset price dynamics. One Central Bank to Rule Them All*14 March 2020 from RFhttps://academic.oup.com/rof/article/24/2/263/5540330?rss=1&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWhile global stock markets enjoy high returns on days surrounding Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, there is no comparable result for other central banks either internationally or, more surprisingly, domestically. Neither announcement surprises nor currency moves drive these findings, which hold even for stocks with a domestic focus. The difference in announcement premia is not explained by economy size, exposure to multinationals, or policy activism. We conclude that the Fed exerts a unique impact on global equities. Consistent with this hypothesis, uncertainty drops across global markets following FOMC announcements but not those of other central banks. Furthermore, the Fed is generally the leader among central banks in setting monetary policy.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Macroeconomics","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Macroeconomics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Macroeconomics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Macroeconomics","slug":"Macroeconomics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Macroeconomics/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Monetary","slug":"Monetary","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Monetary/"}]},{"title":"Vim Basics","slug":"Vim Basics","date":"2020-01-27T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-18T19:59:43.345Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/27/Vim Basics/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/27/Vim Basics/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction to vim3 modes for vim insert 1+ normal ```esc visual 12345678910#### SearchIn the normal mode, type ```/```, then type what you want to search## Replace+ replace one character / word: + in the normal mode, type ```:s```, then type ```/x```, “x” is what you want to replace, then type ```/y```, “y” is what you want to be replaced with.

Financial market participants do not capture all economic gains from innovation even when they own shares in innovating firms. Such gains accrue partly to the innovators, who cannot sell claims on proceeds from their future ideas. We show how the resulting inequality among agents can give rise to a high risk premium on the aggregate stock market, return co-movement and average return differences among firms, and the failure of traditional representative agent asset pricing models to account for cross-sectional differences in risk premia. Consumption Fluctuations and Expected Returns12 December 2019 From JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12870?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundThis paper introduces a novel consumption‐based variable, cyclical consumption, and examines its predictive properties for stock returns. Future expected stock returns are high (low) when aggregate consumption falls (rises) relative to its trend and marginal utility from current consumption is high (low). We show that the empirical evidence ties consumption decisions of agents to time‐variation in returns in a manner consistent with asset pricing models based on external habit formation. The predictive power of cyclical consumption is not confined to bad times and subsumes the predictability of many popular forecasting variables. Dynamically consistent alpha‐maxmin expected utility17 November 2019 From MFhttps://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/201618/1/IMW_working_paper_593.pdfThe alpha‐maxmin model is a prominent example of preferences under Knightian uncertainty as it allows to distinguish ambiguity and ambiguity attitude. These preferences are dynamically inconsistent for nontrivial versions of alpha.In this paper, we derive a recursive, dynamically consistent version of the alpha‐maxmin model. In the continuous‐time limit, the resulting dynamic utility function can be represented as a convex mixture between worst and best case, but now at the local, infinitesimal level. We study the properties of the utility function and provide an Arrow–Pratt approximation of the static and dynamic certainty equivalent. We then derive a consumption‐based capital asset pricing formula and study the implications for derivative valuation under indifference pricing. Turning alphas into betas: Arbitrage and endogenous risk09 March 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300441?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundThis paper tests the idea that financial intermediaries who act as arbitrageurs in the asset market help determine the equilibrium risk of financial assets. They do this by turning alphas into betas; assets with large abnormal returns attract more arbitrage and covary correspondingly more with systematic shocks to arbitrage capital. I show that this channel explains the cross-sectional variation in the funding liquidity and the arbitrageur wealth portfolio betas of equity anomaly portfolios. My results highlight that intermediaries who act as arbitrageurs not only price cross-sections of assets given risks but also actively shape these risks through the act of arbitrage. MethodStock Return Asymmetry: Beyond Skewness28 January 2020 form JFQAhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022109019000206?urlappend=%3Fsource%3Drss&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe propose two asymmetry measures for stock returns. Unlike the popular skewness measure, our measures are based on the distribution function of the data rather than just the third central moment. We present empirical evidence that the greater upside asymmetries calculated using our new measures imply lower average returns in the cross section of stocks. In contrast, when using the skewness measure, the relationship between asymmetry and returns is inconclusive. What you see is not what you get: The costs of trading market anomalies10 March 2020 from JFEhttps://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/10161/15676/1/The%20Costs%20of%20Trading%20Market%20Anomalies.pdfIs there a gap between the profitability of a trading strategy on paper and that which is achieved in practice? We answer this question by developing a general technique to measure the real-world implementation costs of financial market anomalies. Our method extends Fama-MacBeth regressions to compare the on-paper returns to factor exposures with those achieved by mutual funds. Unlike existing approaches, ours delivers estimates of all-in implementation costs without relying on parametric microstructure models or explicitly specified factor trading strategies. After accounting for implementation costs, typical mutual funds earn low returns to value and no returns to momentum. FactorTaming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors24 January 2020 from JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12883We propose a model selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high‐dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology accounts for model selection mistakes that produce a bias due to omitted variables, unlike standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are shown to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. Lazy Prices29 January 2020 from JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12885Using the complete history of regular quarterly and annual filings by U.S. corporations, we show that changes to the language and construction of financial reports have strong implications for firms’ future returns and operations. A portfolio that shorts “changers” and buys “nonchangers” earns up to 188 basis points per month in alpha (over 22% per year) in the future. Moreover, changes to 10‐Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm‐level bankruptcies. Unlike typical underreaction patterns, we find no announcement effect, suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Asset-Pricing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Asset Pricing","slug":"Asset-Pricing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Asset-Pricing/"},{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"}]},{"title":"Financial Market Papers","slug":"Summary of Financial Market Papers","date":"2020-01-27T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-03-11T15:22:08.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/27/Summary of Financial Market Papers/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/27/Summary of Financial Market Papers/","excerpt":"","text":"High-Frequency TradingHigh‐Frequency Trading and Market Performance23 January 2020 from JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12882We study the consequences of, and potential policy responses to, high‐frequency trading (HFT) via the tradeoff between liquidity and information production. Faster speeds facilitate HFT, with consequences for this tradeoff: information production decreases because informed traders have less time to trade before HFTs react, but liquidity (measured by the bid‐ask spread) improves because informational asymmetries decline. HFT also pushes outcomes inside the frontier of this tradeoff. However, outcomes can be restored to the frontier by replacing the limit order book with one of two alternative mechanisms: delaying all orders except cancellations or implementing frequent batch auctions. Market StructureThickness and Information in Dynamic Matching Markets01 Feb 2020 from JPEhttps://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/704761?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe introduce a simple model of dynamic matching in networked markets, where agents arrive and depart stochastically and the composition of the trade network depends endogenously on the matching algorithm. If the planner can identify agents who are about to depart, then waiting to thicken the market substantially reduces the fraction of unmatched agents. If not, then matching agents greedily is close to optimal. We specify conditions under which local algorithms that choose the right time to match agents, but do not exploit the global network structure, are close to optimal. Finally, we consider a setting where agents have private information about their departure times and design a mechanism to elicit this information. Investor Experiences and Financial Market Dynamics15 November 2019https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X19302703?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundHow do macrofinancial shocks affect investor behavior and market dynamics? Recent evidence on experience effects suggests a long-lasting influence of personally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment but also significant differences across older and younger generations. We formalize experience-based learning in an overlapping generations (OLG) model, where different cross-cohort experiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices, and trade. The model allows us to characterize a novel link between investor demographics and the dependence of prices on past dividends while also generating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return predictability. The model produces new implications for the cross-section of asset holdings, trade volume, and investors’ heterogeneous responses to recent financial crises, which we show to be in line with the data. Mean‐field games with differing beliefs for algorithmic trading26 February 2020 From MFhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06101Even when confronted with the same data, agents often disagree on a model of the real world. Here, we address the question of how interacting heterogeneous agents, who disagree on what model the real world follows, optimize their trading actions.The market has latent factors that drive prices, and agents account for the permanent impact they have on prices. This leads to a large stochastic game, where each agents performance criteria are computed under a different probability measure.We analyze the mean‐field game (MFG) limit of the stochastic game and show that the Nash equilibrium is given by the solution to a nonstandard vector‐valued forward–backward stochastic differential equation. Under some mild assumptions, we construct the solution in terms of expectations of the filtered states. Furthermore, we prove that the MFG strategy forms an ε‐Nash equilibrium for the finite player game. Finally, we present a least square Monte Carlo based algorithm for computing the equilibria and show through simulations that increasing disagreement may increase price volatility and trading activity. What Matters to Individual Investors? Evidence from the Horse’s Mouth27 Feb 2020 from JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12895We survey a representative sample of U.S. individuals about how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and decisions. We find substantial support for many factors hypothesized to affect portfolio equity share, particularly background risk, investment horizon, rare disasters, transactional factors, and fixed costs of stock market participation. Individuals tend to believe that past mutual fund performance is a good signal of stock‐picking skill, actively managed funds do not suffer from diseconomies of scale, value stocks are safer and do not have higher expected returns, and high‐momentum stocks are riskier and do have higher expected returns. FundStar Ratings and the Incentives of Mutual Funds01 Feb 2020 from JFhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12888?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe propose a theory of reputation to explain how investors rationally respond to mutual fund star ratings. A fund’s performance is determined by its information advantage, which can be acquired but decays stochastically. Investors form beliefs about whether the fund is informed based on its past performance. We refer to such beliefs as fund reputation, which determines fund flows. As performance changes continuously, equilibrium fund reputation may take discrete values only and thus can be labeled with stars. Star upgrades thus imply reputation jumps, leading to discrete increases in flows and expected performance, although stars do not provide new information. Prime (information) brokerage20 February 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2030043X?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe show that hedge funds gain an information advantage from their prime broker banks regarding the banks’ corporate borrowers. The connected hedge funds make abnormally large trades in the stocks of borrowing firms prior to loan announcements, and these trades outperform other trades.The outperformance is particularly strong for trades of hedge funds that have high revenue potential for prime broker banks. These informed trades appear to be based on information not just about the loan itself but also about firms’ fundamentals such as future earnings. Finally, we find evidence suggesting that equity analysts inside the banks are one potential conduit of information transfer. OTCDynamic Asset Sales with a Feedback Effect10 June 2019 from RFShttps://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/2/829/5513178?rss=1&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound I analyze a dynamic model of over-the-counter asset sales in which the seller receives stock-sensitive compensation, and the transaction conveys information about the firm’s value. I examine how the market’s response to an asset sale feeds back to the seller’s decision on the timing and the sale price and analyze the unique pattern of stock prices before and after the sale. The implications of bargaining power, inventories, gains from synergy, and the introduction of a vesting period are discussed. The model sheds light on observed properties of corporate sell-offs and explains market dry-ups during downturn periods. Pricing and Liquidity in Decentralized Asset Markets02 December 2019 from Econometricahttps://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/73901/1/MPRA_paper_73901.pdfI develop a search‐and‐bargaining model of endogenous intermediation in over‐the‐counter markets. Unlike the existing work, my model allows for rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions: preferences, inventories, and meeting rates. By comparing trading‐volume patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue that the heterogeneity in meeting rates is the main driver of intermediation patterns. I find that investors with higher meeting rates (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: (i) fast investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and (ii) fast investors hold more extreme inventories. Then, I use the model to study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of liquidity. On social welfare, I show that the interaction of meeting rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management makes the equilibrium inefficient. I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors cross‐subsidize slow investors. CrisisInformational Channels of Financial Contagion05 February 2020 from Econometricahttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA15604?af=R&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound Two main classes of channels are studied as informational sources of financial contagion. One is a fundamental channel that is based on real and financial links between economies, and the second is a social learning channel that arises when agents base their decisions on noisy observations about the actions of others in foreign markets. Using global games, I present a two‐country model of financial contagion in which both channels can operate and I test its predictions experimentally. The experimental results show that subjects do not extract information optimally, which leads to two systematic biases that affect these channels directly. Base‐rate neglect leads subjects to underweight their prior, and thus weakens the fundamental channel. An overreaction bias strengthens the social learning channel, since subjects rely on information about the behavior of others, even when this information is irrelevant. These results have significant welfare effects rooted in the specific way in which these biases alter behavior. The Importance of Being Special: Repo Markets During the Crisis13 February 2020 from JFEhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2065.en.pdfWe study how the Italian sovereign bond scarcity premia, specialness, in the repo market were affected by the European Central Bank (ECB)’s purchases during the euro area sovereign debt crisis. We propose and calibrate a search-based dynamic model with a central bank acting as a buy-and-hold investor. Consistent with model predictions, ECB purchases drive specialness of targeted securities in combination with short-selling. Special benchmark bonds entail a positive cash premium, but their market liquidity decreases when purchased by the ECB. Short-sellers were more likely to fail-to-deliver very special bonds, while holders of these bonds were less inclined to pledge them as collateral to the ECB liquidity operations. Phenomenon / ProductsPre-Trade Hedging: Evidence from the Issuance of Retail Structured Products12 February 2020 from JFEhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300374?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inboundWe find evidence consistent with previously unrecognized market manipulation by broker-dealers. Specifically, we show that pre-trade hedging, which is distinct from front-running, alters prices at which derivative trades occur. We show this behavior is intentional by exploiting variation in the design of structured equity products (SEPs). We find positive abnormal returns on SEP pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar SEPs. We also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when SEP issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices.","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Literature Review","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/"},{"name":"Financial Market","slug":"Economics/Literature-Review/Financial-Market","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Literature-Review/Financial-Market/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Papers","slug":"Papers","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Papers/"},{"name":"Financial Market","slug":"Financial-Market","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Financial-Market/"}]},{"title":"SQL Keys","slug":"SQL Keys","date":"2020-01-25T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-01-26T19:09:14.013Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/25/SQL Keys/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/25/SQL Keys/","excerpt":"","text":"Key TerminologyThree Kinds of KeysPrimary key generally an integer autoincrement field, indicating the row.

Understanding Data Types in Python to part of Operations of NumPy arrays was on Aug 5th; The rest was on Aug 6th. Understanding Data Types in PythonStatically-typing &amp; Dynamic typingA statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, while Python skips this specification. 1234result = 0for i in range(100): result += iprint(result) This means we can assign any kind of data to any variable. Behind the python: flexibilityThe standard Python implementation is written in C, which means every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, not only its value, but other information as well. IntegerA single integer in Python 3.4 contains four pieces. ob_refcnt ob_type ob_size ob_digit A python integer is a pointer to a position in memory containing all the Python object information, including the bytes that contain the integer value. ListList is almost the most flexibility type in Python. 123L = list(range(10))Ltype(L[0]) output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] int Change it to a list of strings: 123L2 = [str(c) for c in L]L2type(L2[0]) output: [&#39;0&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;] str Or we can create heterogeneous lists: 12L3 = [True, \"2\", 3.0, 4][type(item) for item in L3] output: [bool, str, float, int] Flexibility comes with a cost (loss of storage and efficiency). In the special case that all variables are of the same type, much of this flexibility is redundant. Then comes with fixed-type NumPy-style array. ArrayThe built in array module can be used to create dense arrays of a uniform type: 1234import arrayL = list(range(10))A = array.array('i', L)A output: array(&#39;i&#39;, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) However, the NumPy Array is more efficient than array because of the operations on data. Overlook of NumPy arraysBasic NumPy array syntax:basic syntax: 12import numpy as npnp.array([1,4,2,5,3]) output: array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3]) The type of elements in array should, but does not have to, be the same. If the types do not match, Numpy will upcast if possible. 1np.array([3.14, 4, 2, 3]) output: array([3.14, 4. , 2. , 3. ]) Here, integers are up-cast to floating point. And we can use dtype keyword to set the data type: 1np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='float32') output: array([1., 2., 3., 4.], dtype=float32) NumPy array as matrixNumpy arrays can explicity be muti-dimensional, using a list of lists: 12# nested lists result in multi-dimensional arraysnp.array([range(i, i+3) for i in [2, 4, 6]]) output: array([[2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]]) for better understanding, we can run a 2*2 array: 1np.array([range(i, i+2) for i in [2, 4]]) output array([[2, 3], [4, 5]]) or a 3*10 array: 1np.array([range(i, i+10) for i in [2, 4, 6]]) output: array([[ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]]) It is more efficient to create arrays from scratch using routines built into Numpy: zero array with 10 integer: 1np.zeros(10, dtype=int) output: array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) one array: 1np.ones((3,5), dtype=float) output: array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]]) An array with some identical elements: 1np.full((3, 5), 3.14) output: array([[3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14], [3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14], [3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14]]) A linear sequence 123# create an array filled with a linear sequence# starting at 0, this is similar to the built-in range() functionnp.arange(0, 20, 2) output: array([ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]) linspace 123# create an array of five values evenly spaced# between 0 and 1np.linspace(0, 1, 5) output: array([0. , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1. ]) uniformly distributed random value 12# create a 3*e arrayof uniformly distributed random values between 0 and 1np.random.random((3, 3)) output: array([[0.57226098, 0.56849713, 0.63410602], [0.88335333, 0.46056684, 0.95494879], [0.22305721, 0.18478839, 0.78352821]]) normal distributed random value 1np.random.normal(0, 1, (3, 3)) output: array([[ 1.05100904, 1.71407429, 0.75356105], [-0.61885082, 0.43198626, 0.63819954], [-0.53911965, 1.07533192, -0.27227068]]) random value 12# create a 3*3 array of random integers in the interval [0, 10]np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3)) output: array([[0, 7, 1], [2, 7, 6], [7, 8, 5]]) create identity matrix 12# create a 3*3 identity matrixnp.eye(3) output: array([[1., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.]]) uninitialized array 1234# create an uninitialized array of three integers# the values will be whatever happens to # already exist at that memory locationnp.empty(3) output: array([1., 1., 1.]) Standard Data Types numpy is also built in C, the data type can be specified using a string: 12np.zeros(10, dtype = 'int16')np.zeros(10, dtype = np.int16) #same output array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int16) Operations of NumPy arrays attributes of arrays indexing of arrays slicing of arrays reshaping of arrays joining and splitting of arrays Attributes of arraysdetermining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays We can use random number generator, which we will seed with a set value in order to ensure that the same random arrays are generated each time this code is run: 1234567np.random.seed(0)# seed for reproducibilityx1 = np.random.randint(10, size=6)x2 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4))x3 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4, 5))print(x1)print(x2)print(x3) output: [5 0 3 3 7 9] [[3 5 2 4] [7 6 8 8] [1 6 7 7]] ([[[8, 1, 5, 9, 8], [9, 4, 3, 0, 3], [5, 0, 2, 3, 8], [1, 3, 3, 3, 7]], [[0, 1, 9, 9, 0], [4, 7, 3, 2, 7], [2, 0, 0, 4, 5], [5, 6, 8, 4, 1]], [[4, 9, 8, 1, 1], [7, 9, 9, 3, 6], [7, 2, 0, 3, 5], [9, 4, 4, 6, 4]]]) each array has attributes ndim, shape and size: 123print(\"x3 ndim: \", x3.ndim)print(\"x3 shape: \", x3.shape)print(\"x3 size: \", x3.size) output: x3 ndim: 3 x3 shape: (3, 4, 5) x3 size: 60 we can check the type of x3 1print(\"dtype:\", x3.dtype) dtype: int32 itemsize is another attribute, which list the size in bytes of each array element, and nbytes list the total size of the array: 1print(\"itemsize: \", x3.itemsize, \"bytes\") itemsize: 4 In general, we expect that nbytes is equal to itemsize times size. Array IndexingGetting and setting the value of individual array elements 12print(x1[0])print(x1[4]) output: 5 7 use negative indices: 12print(x1[-1])print(x1[-2]) ouptut: 9 7 items can be accessed using a comma-separated tuple of indices: 123print(x2)print(x2[2, 0])print(x2[2, -1]) output: [[3 5 2 4] [7 6 8 8] [1 6 7 7]] 1 7 Values can be modified using any of the above index notation: 123print(x2)x2[0, 0] = 12print(x2) output: [[3 5 2 4] [7 6 8 8] [1 6 7 7]] [[12 5 2 4] [ 7 6 8 8] [ 1 6 7 7]] Numpy arrays have a fixed type. The different type will be silently truncated automatically 12x1[0] = 3.14159 # this will be truncated!x1 output: array([3, 0, 3, 3, 7, 9]) Array SlicingGetting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array The standard Python list slicing is: ​ x[start:stop:step] The default to the values start = 0, stop = size of dimension, step = 1 12x = np.arange(10)x output: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) One-dimensionThis is operation of one-dimensional subarrays 1234567x[:5] # first five elementsx[5:]x[4:7] # middle sub-arrayx[::2] # every other elementx[1::2] # every other element, starting at index1x[::-1] # reversedx[5::-2] # reversed every other from index 5 output: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) array([4, 5, 6]) array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8]) array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) array([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]) array([5, 3, 1]) Multi-dimension1x2 output: array([[12, 5, 2, 4], [ 7, 6, 8, 8], [ 1, 6, 7, 7]]) Some operations of multi-dimensional subarrays 123x2[:2, :3] # first two rows, three columnsx2[:3, ::2] #all rows, every other columnx2[::-1, ::-1] # subarray dimensions can even be reversed together output: array([[12, 5, 2], [ 7, 6, 8]]) array([[12, 2], [ 7, 8], [ 1, 7]]) array([[ 7, 7, 6, 1], [ 8, 8, 6, 7], [ 4, 2, 5, 12]]) Accessing of single rows or columns of an array can be done by combining indexing and slicing, using an empty slice marked by a single colon (:): 123456print(x2[:,0]) #first column of x2print(x2[0,:]) #first row of x2# In the case of row access, the empty slice can be omitted for a more compact syntaxprint(x2[0]) #equivalent output: [12 7 1] [12 5 2 4] [12 5 2 4] Copy &amp; No-Copy SubarraysNumPy array slice return views rather than copies of the array data. However, Python list slicing will be copies. Changed Example Extract a 2*2 subarray from this: 12x2_sub = x2[:2, :2]print(x2_sub) [[12 5] [ 7 6]] The original array is changed: 123x2_sub[0, 0] = 99print(x2_sub)print(x2) output: [[99 5] [ 7 6]] [[99 5 2 4] [ 7 6 8 8] [ 1 6 7 7]] it is a useful property, we can access and process pieces of these datasets without the need to copy the underlying data buffer. Unchanged Example we can also create a explicitly copy the data within an array or a subarray. 123x2_sub_copy = x2[:2,:2].copy()print(x2_sub_copy)print(x2) output: [[99 5] [ 7 6]] [[99 5 2 4] [ 7 6 8 8] [ 1 6 7 7]] If we modify this subarray, the original array is not touched: 123x2_sub_copy[0,0] = 42print(x2_sub_copy)print(x2) output: [[42 5] [ 7 6]] [[99 5 2 4] [ 7 6 8 8] [ 1 6 7 7]] Array ReshapingChanging the shape of a given array 123# put number 1-9 in a 3*3 grid:grid = np.arange(1,10).reshape((3,3))print(grid) output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] The size of the initial array must match the size of the reshaped array. The reshape method will use a no-copy view of the initial array. We can use newaxis method to realize the reshape effect. 1234567x = np.array([1,2,3])x.reshape((1,3))x[np.newaxis, :]x.reshape((3,1))x[:, np.newaxis] output: array([[1, 2, 3]]) array([[1, 2, 3]]) array([[1], [2], [3]]) array([[1], [2], [3]]) Array concatenation and splittingCombining multiple arrays into one, and splitting one array into many Concatenationconcatenation: combine multiple arrays into one 123x = np.array([1, 2, 3])y = np.array([3, 2, 1])np.concatenate([x, y]) output: array([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]) In two-dimensional situation, default is zero-indexed. 1234grid = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])# concatenate along the first axisnp.concatenate([grid, grid]) output: array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) We can concatenate along the second axis (zero-indexed). 12# zero-indexednp.concatenate([grid, grid], axis=1) output: array([[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]]) vstack: vertically stack the arrays 1234x = np.array([1,2,3])grid = np.array([[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4]])np.vstack([x, grid]) output: array([[1, 2, 3], [9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4]]) hstack: horizontally stack the arrays 1234# horizontaly = np.array([[99], [99]])np.hstack([grid, y]) output: array([[ 9, 8, 7, 99], [ 6, 5, 4, 99]]) Splitingsplit: opposite of concatenation. 123x = [1, 2, 3, 99, 99, 3, 2, 1]x1, x2, x3 = np.split(x, [3, 5])print(x1, x2, x3) output: [1 2 3] [99 99] [3 2 1] Notice that N split-points, leads to N+1 subarrays. np.hsplit and np.vsplit are similar. In multi-dimensional situation: 12grid = np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4))grid output: array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6, 7], [ 8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15]]) np.vsplit and np.hsplit 1234567upper, lower = np.vsplit(grid, [2])print(upper)print(lower)left, right = np.hsplit(grid, [2])print(left)print(right) output: [[0 1 2 3] [4 5 6 7]] [[ 8 9 10 11] [12 13 14 15]] [[ 0 1] [ 4 5] [ 8 9] [12 13]] [[ 2 3] [ 6 7] [10 11] [14 15]] Computation and Functions in NumPyThe speed of computation on NumpyComputation can be very fast or very slow. The key to making it fast is to use vectorized operations, generally implemented through universal functions(ufuncs). The Slowness of Loops123456789101112# slowness of loopsimport numpy as npnp.random.seed(0)def compute_reciprocals(values): output = np.empty(len(values)) for i in range(len(values)): output[i] = 1.0 / values[i] return outputvalues = np.random.randint(1, 10, size = 5)compute_reciprocals(values) output: array([0.16666667, 1. , 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.125 ]) If we use this code for a large input, the operation is very slow. 123# IPython's %timeitbig_array = np.random.randint(1, 100. size=1000000)%timeit compute_reciprocals(big_array) It turns out that the bottleneck here is not the operations themselves, but the type-checking and function dispatches that CPython must do at each cycle of the loop. Vectorized OperationHowever, Numpy provides a convenient interface to compile routine, which is named as a vectorized operation. 123print(compute_reciprocals(values))print(1.0 / values)%timeit (1.0 / big_array) Vectorized operations in Numpy are implemented via ufuncs, whose main purpose is to quickly execute repeated operations or values in Numpy arrays. 1np.arange(5) / np.arange(1,6) output: array([0. , 0.5 , 0.66666667, 0.75 , 0.8 ]) Here is the multi-dimensional situation: 12x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))2 ** x output: array([[ 1, 2, 4], [ 8, 16, 32], [ 64, 128, 256]], dtype=int32) We can use these ufuncs to realize various purpose. Computation via NumPy UFuncsUfuncs exist in two flavors: unary ufuncs, which operate on a single input binary ufuncs, which operate on two inputs We can use uFuncs to achieve arithmetic purpose. Array arithmeticThe basic arithmetic operations 1234567891011import numpy as npx=np.arange(4)print(\"x =\", x)print(\"x + 5 =\", x + 5)print(\"x - 5 =\", x - 5)print(\"x + 5 =\", x + 5)print(\"x + 5 =\", x + 5)print(\"x + 5 =\", x + 5)print(\"-x =\", -x) # negationprint(\"x ** 2 =\", x ** 2) # exponentiationprint(\"x % 2 =\", x &amp; 2) # modulus output: 123456789x = [0 1 2 3]x + 5 = [5 6 7 8]x - 5 = [-5 -4 -3 -2]x + 5 = [5 6 7 8]x + 5 = [5 6 7 8]x + 5 = [5 6 7 8]-x = [ 0 -1 -2 -3]x ** 2 = [0 1 4 9]x % 2 = [0 0 2 2] We can also combine them together. these arithmetic are simply wrappers specific functions built into NumPy. 12print(-(0.5* + 1)**2)print(np.add(x, 2)) output: 12-0.25[2 3 4 5] Other arithmetic operators and functions include: 1234abx(x)np.exp(x)np.log(x)np.sin(x) Specialized functions used in statistics exist in scipy 12345from scipy import specialx = [1, 5, 10]print(\"gamma(x) =\", special.gamma(x))print(\"ln|gamma(x)| =\", special.gammaln(x))print(\"beta(x, 2) =\", special.beta(x, 2)) output: 123gamma(x) = [1.0000e+00 2.4000e+01 3.6288e+05]ln|gamma(x)| = [ 0. 3.17805383 12.80182748]beta(x, 2) = [0.5 0.03333333 0.00909091] To summarize the typical values in a dataset, we can use aggregates function. NumPy’s aggregate function version is computed much more quickly. 123L = np.random.random(100)print(sum(L))print(np.sum(L)) 1247.62021077872389447.620210778723894 Timing the different functions: 123big_array = np.random.rand(1000000)%timeit sum(big_array)%timeit np.sum(big_array) ouptut: 12113 ms ± 7.37 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)1.28 ms ± 69.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) For min, max, sum, and several other NumPy aggregates, a shorter syntax is to use methods of the array object itself: 123min(big_array), max(big_array)np.min(big_array), np.max(big_array)print(big_array.min(), big_array.max(), big_array.sum()) output: 123(7.476608001599772e-07, 0.9999999017465359)(7.476608001599772e-07, 0.9999999017465359)7.476608001599772e-07 0.9999999017465359 499703.64780246833 For multi-dimensional aggregates, there are three situation: the entire array, the row and the column. 123M = np.random.random((3, 4))print(M)print(M.sum()) output: 1234[[0.31678953 0.12015542 0.47115746 0.91046151] [0.66547603 0.36825635 0.79325825 0.2072341 ] [0.73285524 0.39698562 0.5593977 0.514694 ]]6.0567212054611375 To calculate aggregate from an axis. 12print(M.min(axis=0))print(M.max(axis=1)) output: 12[0.31678953 0.12015542 0.47115746 0.2072341 ][0.91046151 0.79325825 0.73285524] The axis keyword specifies the dimension of the array will be collapsed, rather than the dimension that will be returned. additionally, most aggregates have a NaN-safe counterpart that computes the result while ignoring values, for example, np.sum and np.nansum.

Having no idea how I will estimate it after many years, I would like to write my frustration and growth, compared to the wonderful life created by the images on the social media, briefly but seriously. Around February last year, I had to experience a gap year without submitting the applications, for the simple reason that the English tests are unfavorable. Thus, the beginning of the age of 22 is a little disappointing for me. Going back to the campus in the last undergraduate semester drove me kind of nervous and embarrassed: after all, lack of offers from both postgraduate schools and employers, as well as consumption of parents’ money in the next few years, was not a honored situation to show. But I was released later because friendly classmates and considerate colleagues didn’t regard it as a big matter, which taught me that peer pressure which always appears in several steps in life is such a subtle mood that on the one hand it stems from personal initiative, but on the other hand, also more importantly, we had better not be coerced by it so as to live in an anxious but unconstructive situation. Now that having decided to apply in the next year, I just wanted to do an internship to accumulate more working experience, which is also the requirement for graduation. Fortunately, I got the opportunity, via Peng, to be a part time assistant in RB to assist Arielle, Peiyao, Jass, Jessie and other mentors in finishing a challenging but interesting project from March to May. Not only did I learn the way of thinking as a consultant with the knowledge about the Internet of Things &amp; Energy and cases, but acquaint and make friends with excellent colleagues and peers. At the same time, I completed my thesis during this period under the routine of library-canteen-dormitory. To be honest, it was exhausting but fulfilling. Time flies. Before the commencement, graduation trip fascinates me to fly to Chongqing, Chengdu and Xi’an with other 11 classmates, during which the first time disco dancing, airbnb living, hangover, love stories and et cetera all constituted one of the most memorable experience in my life. I appreciated it. However, graduation process cannot be stoppable, even if I still lived in Lin’s dorm 2 weeks after commencement. The old days, I missed them. Oddly enough, the sense of graduation is not strong for me, perhaps because I still have the mission to complete. In August, I went to Beijing and restarted the fight with ETS, which last to November and December. I met numerous comrades in similar situation with dreams but struggles to get the points. The details in these stories are complicated, even unperfect, but the important thing was that I survived. I still remember the slogan of ETS: “Go Anywhere From Here.” It may means how widespread and well-accepted it is all over the world. However, I prefer regarding it as below: after beating it, anyone will be bestowed the courage to go anywhere. I spent most of my struggling time at home, Zhengzhou, with parents, which was also an appropriate time to consider what I really want and what really matters in life. In Zhengzhou, there is an English corner where I have met a group of sagacious and experienced people. At the meantime, I learned how to cook and feed myself, how to drive a car, and how to deal with my inner impulse and frustration without a supervision and “normal” pace. From the aspect of the result of my application, the age of 22 is unamiable and unperfect, but I still eager to regard it as a worthwhile and well-rounded wealth, because I still need my endeavor to protect my dream in the brand new age of 23.","categories":[{"name":"Thoughts","slug":"Thoughts","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Thoughts/"},{"name":"Personal Journals","slug":"Thoughts/Personal-Journals","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Thoughts/Personal-Journals/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Journal","slug":"Journal","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Journal/"},{"name":"Annual Letter","slug":"Annual-Letter","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Annual-Letter/"}]},{"title":"What I Have Lived For","slug":"What I Have Lived For","date":"2019-03-20T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-03-21T14:01:10.156Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/20/What I Have Lived For/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/03/20/What I Have Lived For/","excerpt":"","text":"This prose is the prologue to Bertrand Russell’s Autobiography, where the three passions have been motivating me since the high school. Below is Russell’s original text: Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair. I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness—that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what—at last—I have found. With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved. Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer. This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.","categories":[{"name":"Thoughts","slug":"Thoughts","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Thoughts/"},{"name":"Other","slug":"Thoughts/Other","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Thoughts/Other/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Journal","slug":"Journal","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Journal/"}]},{"title":"Python Pandas Basics","slug":"Python Pandas Basics","date":"2019-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-08-07T17:42:39.557Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/18/Python Pandas Basics/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/03/18/Python Pandas Basics/","excerpt":"","text":"This note contains basic knowledge of pandas including basic syntax and so on. Posted on Aug 6th is a draft. 1. Data Type in Pandaspandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy. Series and DataFrame is the basic data type. Pandas provides efficient access to these sorts of “data munging” tasks that occupy much of a data scientist’s time. 1.1 Series1.1.1 Series BasicsSeries is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. 123import pandas as pddata = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])data output: 123450 0.251 0.502 0.753 1.00dtype: float64 The values are simply a familiar Numpy array and the index is an array-like of type pd.index. 12data.valuesdata.index output: 12array([0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1. ])RangeIndex(start=0, stop=4, step=1) we can access the element in the series via square-bracket notation. 12print(data[1])print(data[1:3]) output: 12340.51 0.502 0.75dtype: float64 1.1.2 Series IndexSeries is similar to one-dimensional NumPy Array. The essential difference is the presence of the index: while the NumPy Array has an implicitly de fined integer index used to access the values, the Pandas Series has an explicitly de fined index associated with the values. we can define the index with any desired type when creating a series 12data = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], index=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"])data output: 12345a 0.25b 0.50c 0.75d 1.00dtype: float64 We can access the element by using index 1data[\"b\"] output: 10.5 Here, series is a bit like a specialization of a Python dictionary. It is even more clear and efficient than dictionary in Python. 12345678population_dict = &#123;'California': 38332521, 'Florida': 19652860, 'Illinois':12882135, 'New York': 19651127, 'Texas': 26448193 &#125;population = pd.Series(population_dict)population output: 123456California 38332521Florida 19652860Illinois 12882135New York 19651127Texas 26448193dtype: int64 Here, series is a bit like a specialization of a Python dictionary.

The ‘data’ can be a list or Numpy array, can be a scalar, can be a dictionary 123pd.Series(5, index = [100, 200, 300])pd.Series(&#123;2:'a', 1:'b', 3:'c'&#125;)pd.Series(&#123;2:'a', 1:'b', 3:'c'&#125;, index = [3, 2]) output: 1234567891011100 5200 5300 5dtype: int642 a1 b3 cdtype: object3 c2 adtype: object In this case, the Series is populated only wit the explicitly identified keys. 1.2 DataFrame1.2.1 DataFrame BasicsDataframe can be thought of either as a generalization of a NumPy array, or as a specialization of a Python dictionary. It is an analog of a two dimensional array with flexible row indices and column names. 12345678area_dict = &#123;'California': 423967, 'Florida': 170312 , 'Illinois':149995, 'New York': 141297, 'Texas': 696562 &#125;area = pd.Series(area_dict)area output: 123456California 423967Florida 170312Illinois 149995New York 141297Texas 696562dtype: int64 we can use a dictionary to construct a single two-dimensional object: 12states = pd.DataFrame(&#123;'population': population, 'area': area&#125;)states output: population area California 38332521 423967 Florida 19652860 170312 Illinois 12882135 149995 New York 19651127 141297 Texas 26448193 696562 DataFrame also has index attribute that gives access to the index lables: 12states.indexstates.columns output: 12Index([California, Florida, Illinois, New York,Texas], dtype=object)Index([area, population], dtype=object) A Pandas Dataframe can be constructed in variety of ways a. from a single Series object: 1pd.DataFrame(population, columns=['popluation']) output: popluation California 38332521 Florida 19652860 Illinois 12882135 New York 19651127 Texas 26448193 b. from a list of dicts: 123data = [&#123;'a':i, 'b':2 * i&#125;

Except the covariance, other conceptions are about one random variable. Random Variables and DistributionRandom VariablesNumerical quantities whose values are determined by the outcome of the experiment are known as random variables. Hence, we can assign probabilities to their possible values. The set of this probabilities is distribution. In fact, random variables can be discrete or continuous. The possible values of discrete random variables constituted sets of discrete values, whereas continuous random variables whose set of possible values is instead a continuous region can take on any value within some interval. Actually, the distribution differs random variables from general variables in calculus. A random variable must have its own distribution. DistributionFor discrete variables, the distribution is a sequence form. If $X$ is a discrete random variable whose possible values are $x_1, x_2,…,x_n$, then the set of probabilities $P\\{X=x_j\\}$$(j=1,…,n)$ is called the probability distribution of discrete random variable. Since $X$ must assume one of these values, it follows that \\begin{equation*} \\displaystyle{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}}~P\\{X = x_j\\} = 1. \\end{equation*}For continuous variables, the distribution is a function form. Every continuous random variable $X$ has a function $f$ associated with it. This function $f$ is called the probability density function of $X$. For any numbers $a&lt;b$, the area under $f$ between $a$ and $b$ is equal to the probability that $X$ assumes a value between $a$ and $b$. P\\{a \\leq X \\leq b \\} = area ~ under ~ f ~ between ~ a ~ and ~ bDistribution FunctionIf $X$ is a random variable, for any real number x, we define F(x) = P(X \\leq x)as the distribution function of random variable $X$, which is also called $X$ is denoted by $F(x)$, or $X \\sim F(x)$. Sometimes, $F_{X}(x)$ is the same meaning. Sometimes it is also called cumulative distribution function(CDF). Any random variable has its own distribution function, no matter it is discrete or continuous. And here are three fundamental properties. monotonicity $F(x)$ is a monotonic and nondecreasing function on the $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. that is to say, for any $x_1&lt;x_2$, F(x_1) \\leq F(x_2) boundedness For any $x$, $0 \\leq F(x) \\leq 1$, and \\begin{align*} F(-\\infty)=\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty}F(x)=0 \\\\ F(\\infty)=\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}F(x)=1 \\end{align*} right continuity $F(x)$ is the right-continuous function of $x$, that is to say, for any $x_0$, \\lim_{x \\to x_0}F(x)=F(x_0) \\\\ F(x_0+0)=F(x_0) These three fundamental properties are necessary and sufficient conditions whether a function is a distribution function. Mass &amp; Density FunctionFor a discrete random variable $X$, the probability can be values like $x_1, x_2,…,x_n,…$, then the probability of $X$ equals $x_i$: p_i = p_i(x_i)=P(X=x_i),~~i=1,2,...,n,...is called the sequence of probability distribution, or the probability mass function of $X$. The abbreviation is PMF. And the cumulative distribution function of $X​$ is: F(x)=\\sum_{x_i \\leq x}p(x_i)For a continuous random variable $X$, the cumulative distribution function of is $F(x)$, if $\\exists$ a nonnegative integrable function $p(x)$, such that for any real number $x$, F(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{x}p(t)dtthen $p(x)$ is called the probability density function of $X$, sometimes the a shorter name is density or PDF. And here are two fundamental properties to determine whether a function is a probability density function or not. non-negativity p(x) \\geq 0 regularity \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(x)dx=1Expected ValuesIf X is a random variable whose possible values are $x_1, x_2,…,x_n​$, then the expected value of $X​$, denoted by $E[X]​$, is defined by \\begin{equation*} E[X] = \\displaystyle{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}}~{x_j}P\\{X = x_j\\} \\end{equation*}$E[X]​$ also has alternative names: expectation or the mean of $X​$. It is a kind of weighted average of possible values of $X​$, where the weight given to a value is equal to the probability that $X​$ assumes that value. Actually we can define it more accurately. For an infinite sequence of discrete random variables $p(x_i)=P(X=x_i), i=1,2,…,n,…$, if \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}|x_i|p(x_i)","categories":[{"name":"Mathematics","slug":"Mathematics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/"},{"name":"Probability","slug":"Mathematics/Probability","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/Probability/"},{"name":"Probability Theory","slug":"Mathematics/Probability/Probability-Theory","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/Probability/Probability-Theory/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Probability","slug":"Probability","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Probability/"},{"name":"Statistics","slug":"Statistics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Statistics/"}]},{"title":"NYU Tandon Webinar","slug":"NYU Tandon Webinar","date":"2019-02-11T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-02-12T16:29:34.943Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/02/11/NYU Tandon Webinar/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/02/11/NYU Tandon Webinar/","excerpt":"","text":"NYU Tandon Engineering Admitted Student Webinar I attended the NYU Engineering Webinar which introduces some basic information of NYU as well as Tandon Engineering school, life in NYC, future opportunities and the next steps for admitted students. Here are some impressive slides. NYU has 3 portal campuses and 11 global academic centers where NYU students have access to the academic resources. Numbers of NYU speak for themselves. The life in New York city will be fabulous. The value of graduates from NYU Tandon School of Engineering The cost is a relatively tremendous burden for me and my family, which push me a lot. Finally, here is a quote from Andrew Hamilton, NYU President, I want to share with you. Here at NYU, we should remind ourselves who are we as a community: We reject intimidation and discrimination; we strive for diversity and inclusiveness; and we are a community in which each person takes as his or her responsibility the welfare and well-being of others, irrespective of citizenship, faith, race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or any of the other identities that might, but surely need not, divide us.

A set may have many upper bounds. Lower Bound Similarly, if $ \\exists ~ m \\in R$, such that $ \\forall ~ x \\in S$, $x \\geq m $, then $m$ is called an lower bound for $S$, or $S$ has an lower bound. And $S$ is said to be bounded below. A set may have many upper bounds and lower bounds. If a set $S$ has both upper bounds and lower bounds, then $S$ is called the bounded set. Evidently, it is equivalent to: \\exists ~ X > 0, such ~ that ~ \\forall ~ x \\in S, |x| \\leq XSupremum &amp; Infimum Supremum Let $U$ be a set of upper bounds of $S$. Obviously it has no maximum element. And let the minimum of $U$ be $\\beta$, then $\\beta$ is called the least upper bound of $S$, which is also called the supremum of $S$. It is denoted as \\beta = sup ~ SThere are two properties of supremum $\\beta$ $\\beta$ is an upper bound of $S$: $\\forall ~ x \\in S$, $x \\leq \\beta$. Any number that is less than $\\beta$ is not the upper bound of $S$: $\\forall ~ \\varepsilon &gt; 0$, $\\exists ~ x \\in S$, such that $x &gt; \\beta - \\varepsilon$. Infimum Similarly, let $L$ be a set of upper bounds of $S$. Obviously it has no minimum element. And let the maximum of $L$ be $\\alpha$, then $\\alpha$ is called the greatest lower bound of $S$, which is also called the infimum of $S$.

Supremum and Infimum Theorem A nonempty set of real numbers that’s bounded above has supremum. A nonempty set of real numbers that’s bounded below has infimum.

Probability SpaceFinite Sample SpaceGenerally, a set of all the possible results of a certain experiment $S$ is call the sample space, which is denoted as $\\Omega$. All the results of the experiment, which are also in the $\\Omega$ are called the sample point, denoted as $\\omega$. \\Omega = \\{\\omega|\\omega ~ \\text{are sample points of the experiment S} \\}Classical Model of ProbabilityConsider an experiment with a finite sample space $\\Omega = \\{\\omega_1,\\omega_2,…,\\omega_m\\}$. Suppose that there are numbers $p_1, p_2, …, p_m​$ with p_i \\geq 0, ~ i = 1, 2,..., m, ~~ and ~~ \\displaystyle{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m}p_i = 1 ​and such that $p_i​$ is the probability that $i​$ is the outcome of the experiment $S​$. Any set of possible outcomes of the experiment is called an event. If $P(A)​$ denote the probability that event A occurs, then \\begin{equation*} P(A) = \\sum_{i \\in A} ~ p_i = \\frac{\\text{number of elements in event A}}{\\text{total number of elements in sample space $\\Omega$}} \\end{equation*}If these $p_1,p_2,…,p_m$ all exist with each other, this situation is called the classical model of probability. And we can easily deduce that \\begin{equation*} P(S) = \\sum_{i} ~ p_i = 1 \\end{equation*}For any event $A$, let $A^c$, called the complement of $A$, be the event containing all those outcomes in $S$ that are not in $A$. That is, $A^c$ occurs if and only if $A$ does not. Since \\begin{align*} 1 &= \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i}} ~ p_i \\\\ &= \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in A}} ~ p_i + \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in A^c}} ~ p_i \\\\ &= P(A) + P(A^c) \\\\ \\end{align*}So it implies that \\begin{equation*} P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \\end{equation*}For $ \\varnothing = S^c $, we can obtain that \\begin{equation*} P(\\varnothing) = 0 \\end{equation*}Based on simple principle of set theory, \\begin{align*} A \\cup B &= A + B\\bar{A} \\\\ A &= AB+A\\bar{B} \\\\ &= A(B+\\bar{B}) \\end{align*}for any events $A$ and $B$, we can write \\begin{align*} P(A \\cup B) &= \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in A \\cup B}} ~ p_i \\\\ P(A) &= \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in A}} ~ p_i \\\\ P(B) &= \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in B}} ~ p_i \\\\ \\end{align*}And the addition theorem of probability for two events can be written that \\begin{align*} P(A \\cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\\\ P(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_N) &= \\sum_{i=1}^{N}P(E_i)-\\sum_{i_1","categories":[{"name":"Mathematics","slug":"Mathematics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/"},{"name":"Probability","slug":"Mathematics/Probability","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/Probability/"},{"name":"Probability Theory","slug":"Mathematics/Probability/Probability-Theory","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Mathematics/Probability/Probability-Theory/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Probability","slug":"Probability","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Probability/"}]},{"title":"C++ Functions","slug":"C++ Functions","date":"2019-01-27T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-02-01T02:25:03.660Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/01/27/C++ Functions/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/01/27/C++ Functions/","excerpt":"","text":"This note contains basic knowledge of functions in C++ including definition, invocation, overloading and so on. definition of functionssyntax: type identifier Name(formal parameter){ statements return} tips: If the type identifier is void, there is no need to include a return statement in the function body. invocation of functions1. declaration prototypesyntax: function prototype: type identifier Name(formal parameter with type notifications) tips: if a function is defined after the invocation point, its prototype must be declared before invocation. if a function is defined before the invocation point, there is no need to declare the prototype. 2. invocationsyntax: Name(argument) 3.1. write a function to compute the n power of x #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std double power(double x, int n){ dowble val = 1.0; while(n--) val *= x; return val; } int main(){ double pow; pow = power(5, 2): cout &lt;&lt; &quot;5 to the power 2 is &quot; &lt;&lt; pow &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; } 3.2. write a function to converse an input number from binary to decimal #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; double power(double x, int n); int main() { int value = 0; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter an 8 bit binary number: &quot;; for (int i = 7; i &gt;= 0; i--) { char ch; cin &gt;&gt; ch; if (ch == &#39;1&#39;) value += static_cast&lt;int&gt;(power(2, i)); } cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Decimal value is &quot; &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; } //compute the n power of x double power (double x, int n) { double val = 1.0; while (n--) val *= x; return val; } 3.3. write a function to compute the value of Pi #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; double arctan(double x) { double sqr = x * x; double e = x; double r = 0; int i = 1; while (e / i &gt; 1e-15) { double f = e / i; r = (i % 4 == 1) ?

Classification of financial instruments basic securities fixed income bonds bank account loans equities stocks derivatives and contracts options (nonlinear function of a stock) calls &amp; pulls exotic options swaps futures &amp; forwards credit risk derivatives stocks issued by firms to finance operations represent ownership of the firm price known today, but not in the future may or may not pay diviends bonds price known today future payoffs known at fixed dates otherwise the price movement is random final payoff at maturity: face value/ nominal value/principal intermediate payoffs: coupons exposed to default/credit risk derivatives Sell for a price/value/premium today. Future value derived from the value of theunderlying securities (as a function ofthose). Traded at exchanges – standardizedcontracts, no credit risk; Over-the-counter (OTC) – a network ofdealers and institutions, can be nonstandard, some credit risk. Why derivatives? To hedge risk (primary reason) To speculate To attain “arbitrage” profit To exchange one type of payoff for another To circumvent regulations (flexible) Forward Contract An agreement to buy (long) or sell (short) a given underlying asset S: Underlying asset could be stock or merchandise At a predetermined future date T (maturity). At a predetermined price F (forward price). F is chosen so that the contract has zero value today. a kind of zero sum game Today: gain &amp; loss are 0 (different from options) Delivery takes place at maturity T: Payoff at maturity: Long: S(T) - F Short: F - S(T) Price F set when the contract is established. S(T) = spot (market) price at maturity Long position: obligation to buy Short position: obligation to sell Differences with options: Delivery has to take place. Zero value today. Example On May 13, a firm enters into a longforward contract to buy one million euros insix months at an exchange rate of 1.3. On November 13, the firm pays F=$1,300,000 and receives S(T)= one million euros. How does the payoff look like at time T as afunction of the dollar value of S(T) spotexchange rate? graphs SwapsAgreement between two parties to exchange two series of payments. Classic interest rate swap: One party pays fixed interest rate payments on a notional amount. Counterparty pays floating (random) interest rate payments on the same notional amount. Floating rate is often linked to LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate), reset at every payment date. The two parties may be exposed to different interest rates in different markets, or to different institutional restrictions, or to different regulations. a swap example New pension regulations require higher investment in fixed income securities by pension funds, creating a problem: liabilities are long-term while new holdings of fixed income securities may be short-term. Instead of selling assets such as stocks, a pension fund can enter a swap, exchanging returns from stocks for fixed income returns. Or, if it wants to have an option not to exchange, it can buy swaptions instead. Example: Swap Comparative AdvantageUS firm B wants to borrow AUD, Australian firm A wants to borrow USD: Firm B can borrow at 5% in USD, 12.6% AUD Firm A can borrow at 7% USD, 13% AUD Expected gain = (7-5) – (13-12.6) = 1.6% Swaps: Bank gains 1.3% on USD, loses 1.1% on AUD, gain=0.2% Firm B gains (12.6-11.9) = 0.7% Firm A gains (7-6.3) = 0.7% Part of the reason for the gain is credit risk involved","categories":[{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Economics/Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/"},{"name":"Derivatives","slug":"Economics/Finance/Derivatives","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Economics/Finance/Derivatives/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Derivatives","slug":"Derivatives","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Derivatives/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Finance","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Finance/"}]},{"title":"C++ Basics","slug":"C++ Basics","date":"2019-01-15T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-03-18T08:05:25.546Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/01/15/C++ Basics/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/01/15/C++ Basics/","excerpt":"","text":"This note contains basic structures of C++ including Iostream, if, while, for controlling statements.

Because of the prevalence of this book, other programmers gradually started to write how to print “Hello World” in their books as the very first program. Afterwards it becomes such a tradition that almostall the programming books will follow it. So does the first web-page of my personal blog when generated automatically by github. Personally speaking, I find that “Hello World” is amazing. For every beginner of programming like me, not only does “Hello World” sound like an appropriate greeting to the new code-world, but indicates the curiosity and a spirit of exploration, which fascinates me a lot. Moreover, it is also a kind of encouragement both for my exploration on this online platform and for my educational journey in several years. Therefore, I believe “Hello World” will be a good start for my personal blog and my life at the near end of the age 22. I plan to make this blog an academics and profession oriented place, with some summarization of Mathematics, Computer Science, Finance or Business idea, which is part of the reason why I call it Guangnan’s Notes. Of course, I will post some stories and retrospect of my life, in a relatively formal way, on the blog. If you are interested in and curious about the other sides about me, please feel free to contact me on the social media. So, Let’s start.
