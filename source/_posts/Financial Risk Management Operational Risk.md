# Operational Risk

## What is Operational Risk

The operations of a bank or financial institution refers to __the mechanism by which these firms put their strategies into practice__ by employing professionals, developing processes, defining best practices and establishing the proper infrastructure (increasingly through the use of emerging technology to achieve strategic objectives.

Managing operational risk is a function of __both internal and external processes__ related to cash and securities and managing client accounts and information. The approach must evolve along with changes in technology, markets and regulation.

More traditional monitoring in the form of periodic credit reviews and operational risks associated with transactional banking such as the segregation or safekeeping of client assets or data protection issues are critical risk monitoring functions

### People

+ __Key person risk__ refers to any institution which relies heavily on one individual,
  whether that be within senior management or operations
+ __Rogue employee or trader risk__ will always remain a concern despite of enhanced and automated methods of managing monitoring employee activity

### Processes

+ Procedural breakdowns in processing and managing market and credit risk as well as meeting compliance and regulatory requirements can create competitive disadvantages or result in opportunity cost and/or actual losses
+ It is important to continually review controls and incentives in place, and adapt to a changing market and regulatory environment

### Systems

+ __Errors__ resulting from outdated systems, lack of systems integration and/or gaps
  where human intervention is needed can raise costs and lower efficiency
+ Increasing use of technology, in particular artificial intelligence, robotics process
  automation and machine learning techniques to eliminate manual, error prone repetitive processes among banks and financial institutions

## Where is Operational risk from

### Market Infrastructure

+ Central Securities Depositories (Euroclear, Clearstream)
+ Global Payments Network (Fedwire, CHIPS, etc.)
+ Exchanges and Clearinghouses (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, LCH, etc.)
+ Securities Financing Transactions (Repo)
+ Role of a Global Custodian in Managing Operational Risk

### Internal Operational Risk Management

+ Identification
+ Assessment
+ Measurement
+ Control and Mitigation
+ Monitoring and Reporting



### CSD

__Shift from Decentralized Physical to Centralized Dematerialized Processing:__ Until the Paperwork Crisis of 1968 NYSE stock certificates were physically delivered until brokers were overwhelmed by high trade volumes Firms failed and the number of failed trades (if delivery did not occur within five days) soared The NYSE established the Central Certificate Service ( to transfer securities electronically, eliminate physical handling, and track shares held by NYSE members

__Central Securities Depositories__ are entities which record legal entitlements to
dematerialized securities and operate transaction settlement systems in those securities Major CSDs, include DTCC, Euroclear and Clearstream

+ __DTCC (Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, formerly CCS)__ DTCC is owned and directed by its users It automates, standardizes, and streamlines capital markets transactions
  + DTC (Depository Trust Corporation) provides clearance, settlement, and information services for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, government and mortgage backed securities, money market instruments, and over the counter derivatives
  + NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) executes multilateral netting to manage transactions between mutual funds and insurance carriers and their respective investors
  + FICC (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation) provides clearing for fixed income securities, including Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities, including real time trade matching, clearing, risk management, and netting for trades in US government debt issues, including repurchase agreements or repos

+ __Euroclear__
+ __Clearstream__

### Payment Networks

__SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)__ is a cooperative utility messaging system formed in 1973 by over 200 banks headquartered in Belgium. In 1977 it replaced Telex technology with a messaging platform to validate and route standardized messages. Over 11 000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries now use SWIFT. As a secure financial messaging system, SWIFT does not perform funds transfer, clearing or settlement. SWIFT payment orders must be settled by correspondent accounts that institutions have with one other.

__Fedwire__ is a real time gross settlement funds transfer system operated by U S Federal Reserve Banks enabling financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between over 9 000 participants.

__Correspondent Banking__ Bilateral arrangement, often involving a reciprocal cross border relationship in multiple currencies. A correspondent banking arrangement involves one bank (the correspondent) providing accounts and related services, to another bank (the respondent), often including its affiliates.

### Exchanges and Clearinghouses

__Securities and derivatives exchanges__ provide a centralized location where securities are listed and traded by a restricted set of brokers who are members of an exchange; recordkeeping is dematerialized and based upon electronic communication networks.

__Alternative trading venues__ and systems including dark pools offer private means to conduct securities transactions These venues have faced increased scrutiny and disclosure (under Regulation ATS) given concerns over conflict of interest and other practices
__Central clearinghouses__ (CCPs) are centralized entities including CME and LCH which mutualize counterparty credit risk in the foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, credit, commodity and weather derivative markets in which they operate CCPs aim to reduce settlement risk via several measures

+ Net offsetting trades between multiple counterparties
+ Require collateral (margin) deposits
+ Provide independent valuation of trades and collateral
+ Monitor creditworthiness of member firms, and
+ Provide a guarantee fund used to cover losses exceeding a defaulting member's collateral 

__Advantages of central counterparty clearing arrangements__ are greater risk transparency, lower processing costs, and clear rules in cases of member default Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, they are novated to a clearinghouse which steps between trader clearing firms to assumes legal counterparty risk for the trade (a trade between members A and B become two trades A CCP and CCP B)

__Disadvantages__ of central clearing include the concentration of risk which was previously decentralized and distributed in the bilateral OTC model, the interdependency of CCPs, which are now have become crucial financial infrastructures following post crisis reform which forced the over the counter derivatives market into central clearing and the limited capital held by CCPs themselves



### Securities Financing Transactions (Repo)



### Global Custodian 

__Global custody and fund services__ providers offer a range of financial services associated with the safekeeping of financial assets including the following:

+ Hold in safekeeping securities such as domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, commodities and cash
+ Facilitate settlement of purchases/sales and deliveries in/out of securities and currency
+ Support asset income collection (regular and special dividends, bond coupons, maturities) and administer related tax withholding documents and foreign tax reclamation
+ Provide corporate action services on securities held such as proxy voting, stock dividends, stock splits, business combinations ( tender offers, bond calls, etc
+ Offer securities lending services
+ Maintain currency cash bank accounts manage cash and perform foreign exchange transactions
+ Perform accounting services such as NAV reporting for mutual funds, accounting services and complex sub accounting services for pension funds

__Operational challenges__ outsourced by investors to custodians include the following:

+ __Active subcustodian management__: Custodians contract with local banks as agents, performing initial and ongoing due diligence on financial strength, custody expertise and capacity, technology, management and infrastructure, ties with local market entities, income and corporate action capabilities, internal/external audit results, contingency plans, insurance coverage and tax expertise
+ __Assist in new market expansion Clients considering expansion__ to a new market tap custody bank expertise on market structure, requirements and regulation When a custodian opens a new market to clients, network market managers work with local market representatives to understand the market and advocate for infrastructure changes to make markets more acceptable to foreign investors
+ __Asset segregation and ringfencing__: Custodians conduct periodic legal reviews of recoverability of securities held on behalf of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the subcustodian, maintaining omnibus and segregated cash and securities accounts in the name of the bank separate from subcustodian assets where possible

## Manage Operational Risk

### Five steps

__Identification__

__Assessment__

__Measurement__

__Control and Mitigation__

__Monitoring and Reporting__



__Compliance risk__: Failure to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, codes of conduct and standards of self regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities of the Firm

+ use the outer communication system (like whatsapp)

+ send restricted data from work desktop to an external domain

__Conduct risk__: Risk that an action (or inaction) by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.

__Legal risk__: Loss primarily caused by actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.

__Estimations and Model Risk:__ Potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs

__Cybersecurity risk__ The Firm devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets
**Business and technology resiliency risk**: Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, flooding, transit strikes, terrorist threats or infectious disease The safety of employees and customers is the highest priority. The Firm’s global resiliency program is intended to enable the recovery of critical business functions and supporting assets ( technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption 

**Payment fraud risk**: Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment.

**Third party outsourcing risk**: To identify and manage the operational risk inherent in outsourcing.

## Quantifying Operating Risk 

Expected versus Unexpected Loss

__Basic Indicator Approach__

Simplest form for banks without significant international operations Banks using the BIA must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage α of positive annual gross income (excluding year where annual gross income is negative or zero):
$$
K_{BIA}=\frac{\sum GI_{1,2,\cdots,n}*\alpha}{n}
$$
__Standard Approach__

This methodology used for internationally active institutions divides bank activities into corporate finance, sales trading, retail, commercial banking, payment settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage Gross income serves as a proxy for the scale of the business and operational risk exposure for each segment Capital charges are calculated by multiplying gross income by a β factor which defines the relationship between industry wide operational risk loss experience and gross income
$$
K_{\text{TSA}}=\frac{\sum_{\text{years}1-3}\max(\sum_{i=1}^{8}GI_{i}*\beta_i)}{3}
$$
Standardized Approach Beta Factors The beta factors are a fixed percentage, set by the Committee, relating the level of required capital to the level of the gross income for each of the eight business lines as follows:

| Business Line             | Beta Factor | NI Average |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Corporate Finance (β1)    | 18%         | 20         |
| Sales & Trading (β2)      | 18%         | 0          |
| Retail Banking (β3)       | 12%         | 20         |
| Commercial Banking (β4)   | 15%         | 25         |
| Payment & Settlement (β5) | 18%         | 15         |
| Agency Services (β6)      | 15%         | 10         |
| Asset Management (β7)     | 12%         | 25         |
| Retail Brokerage (β8)     | 12%         | 15         |

Example:

Under BIA, $\alpha = 15\%$
$$
K_{BIA}=130*15\% = 19.5
$$
Under SA
$$
K_{KSA}=\frac{\sum_{\text{years}1-3}\max(\sum_{i=1}^{8}GI_{i}*\beta_i)}{3} = 18.75
$$
