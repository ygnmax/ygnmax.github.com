NYU Tandon Engineering Admitted Student Webinar

I attended the NYU Engineering Webinar which introduces some basic information of NYU as well as Tandon Engineering school, life in NYC, future opportunities and the next steps for admitted students. Here are some impressive slides.

+ **NYU has 3 portal campuses and 11 global academic centers where NYU students have access to the academic resources.**

+ **Numbers of NYU speak for themselves. **

+ **The cost is a relatively tremendous burden for me and my family, which push me a lot.**

Finally, here is a quote from Andrew Hamilton, NYU President, I want to share with you.

> Here at NYU, we should remind ourselves who are we as a community: We reject intimidation and discrimination; we strive for diversity and inclusiveness; and we are a community in which each person takes as his or her responsibility the welfare and well-being of others, irrespective of citizenship, faith, race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or any of the other identities that might, but surely need not, divide us.

Such a varied and inclusive culture in NYU really fascinates me.
