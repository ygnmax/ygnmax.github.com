It appears to me that, by flipping the screen at the tail of the age of 22, I only posted 10 moments on WeChat in the pasted year. Having no idea how I will estimate it after many years, I would like to write my frustration and growth, compared to the wonderful life created by the images on the social media, briefly but seriously.

Around February last year, I had to experience a gap year without submitting the applications, for the simple reason that the English tests are unfavorable. Thus, the beginning of the age of 22 is a little disappointing for me. Going back to the campus in the last undergraduate semester drove me kind of nervous and embarrassed: after all, lack of offers from both postgraduate schools and employers, as well as consumption of parents' money in the next few years, was not a honored situation to show. But I was released later because friendly classmates and considerate colleagues didn't regard it as a big matter, which taught me that peer pressure which always appears in several steps in life is such a subtle mood that on the one hand it stems from personal initiative, but on the other hand, also more importantly, we had better not be coerced by it so as to live in an anxious but unconstructive situation.

Now that having decided to apply in the next year, I just wanted to do an internship to accumulate more working experience, which is also the requirement for graduation. Fortunately, I got the opportunity, via Peng, to be a part time assistant in RB to assist Arielle, Peiyao, Jass, Jessie and other mentors in finishing a challenging but interesting project from March to May. Not only did I learn the way of thinking as a consultant with the knowledge about the Internet of Things & Energy and cases, but acquaint and make friends with excellent colleagues and peers. At the same time, I completed my thesis during this period under the routine of library-canteen-dormitory. To be honest, it was exhausting but fulfilling.

Time flies. Before the commencement, graduation trip fascinates me to fly to Chongqing, Chengdu and Xi'an with other 11 classmates, during which the first time disco dancing, airbnb living, hangover, love stories and et cetera all constituted one of the most memorable experience in my life. I appreciated it. However, graduation process cannot be stoppable, even if I still lived in Lin's dorm 2 weeks after commencement. The old days, I missed them.

Oddly enough, the sense of graduation is not strong for me, perhaps because I still have the mission to complete. In August, I went to Beijing and restarted the fight with ETS, which last to November and December. I met numerous comrades in similar situation with dreams but struggles to get the points. The details in these stories are complicated, even unperfect, but the important thing was that I survived. I still remember the slogan of ETS: "Go Anywhere From Here." It may means how widespread and well-accepted it is all over the world. However, I prefer regarding it as below: after beating it, anyone will be bestowed the courage to go anywhere.

I spent most of my struggling time at home, Zhengzhou, with parents, which was also an appropriate time to consider what I really want and what really matters in life. In Zhengzhou, there is an English corner where I have met a group of sagacious and experienced people. At the meantime, I learned how to cook and feed myself, how to drive a car, and how to deal with my inner impulse and frustration without a supervision and "normal" pace.

From the aspect of the result of my application, the age of 22 is unamiable and unperfect, but I still eager to regard it as a worthwhile and well-rounded wealth, because I still need my endeavor to protect my dream in the brand new age of 23.
