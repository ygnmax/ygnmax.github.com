# What is linear regression

if we have a dataset with two factors, we would like to summarize this data with a line. The goal of linear regression is to choose a slope $b$ and point $(x_0, y_0)$ that make sense. 
$$
y - y_0 = b(x-x_0)
$$
The point  we would choose is the $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, and the slope we would choose is $r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$. 

Actually We can just manipulate the point and slope by changing the slope and the point,
