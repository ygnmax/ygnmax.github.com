# Empirical Behavioral Asset Pricing

## Googling Investor Sentiment around the World
28 January 2020 from JFQA
http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d881/c405d186d0f15c22c258555f024f03401cf7.pdf
We study __how investor sentiment affects stock prices__ around the world. Relying on households' Google search behavior, we construct a __weekly measure of sentiment for 38 countries during 2004–2014__. We validate the sentiment index in tests using sports outcomes
+ the sentiment measure is a contrarian predictor of country-level market returns. 
+ Furthermore, we document an important role of global sentiment in stock markets.

## Security analysts and capital market anomalies

We examine the value and efficiency of analyst recommendations through the lens of capital market anomalies. 
+ We find that analysts do not fully use the information in anomaly signals when making recommendations. 
    + Analysts tend to give more favorable consensus recommendations to stocks classified as overvalued and, more important, these stocks subsequently tend to have particularly negative abnormal returns. 
    + Analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with __anomaly signals__ are more skilled and __elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns__. 
+ Our findings suggest that __analysts’ biased recommendations__ could be a __source of market friction__ that __impedes the efficient correction of mispricing__.

## Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns

Existing research has found cross-sectional seasonality of stock returns—the periodic outperformance of certain stocks during the same calendar months or weekdays. 
+ We hypothesize that __assets' different sensitivities to investor mood__ explain these effects and imply other seasonalities. 
+ Consistent with our hypotheses, relative performance across individual stocks or portfolios during past high or low mood months and weekdays tends to recur in periods with congruent mood and reverse in periods with noncongruent mood. 
+ Furthermore, assets with __higher sensitivities to aggregate mood—higher mood betas—subsequently earn higher returns__ during ascending mood periods and earn lower returns during descending mood periods.

## Heterogeneous Beliefs and Return Volatility Around Seasoned Equity Offerings
09 March 2020 from JFE
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300623?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound
We investigate the dynamics of heterogeneous beliefs and link them to the volatility pattern throughout the seasoned equity offering (SEO) event window. 
+ In sync with a __reduction in information asymmetry__ related to management information releases around the SEO event, __belief heterogeneity declines__. 
+ Moreover, heterogeneity in beliefs, proxied by either analyst- or institutional-trade-based measures, is __a robust and salient determinant of SEO firm volatility__, which provides an explanation for the volatility timing "puzzle" identified in the SEO market. 
+ Furthermore, the relation between __heterogeneous beliefs and return volatility weakens__ as __short sale constraints tighten__, suggesting a potential causal link.

## Financial Loss Aversion Illusion*
14 March 2020 from RF
https://academic.oup.com/rof/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/rof/rfz002/31517466/rfz002.pdf
We test the proposition that __investors' ability to cope with financial losses is much better than they expect.__ In a panel survey of investors from a large bank in the UK, we ask for their subjective ratings of __anticipated returns__ and __experienced returns__. The time period covered by the panel (2008–10) is one where investors experienced frequent losses and gains in their portfolios. This period offers a unique setting to evaluate investors' hedonic experiences. 
+ We examine how the subjective ratings behave relative to expected portfolio returns and experienced portfolio returns. __Loss aversion is strong for anticipated outcomes__; investors __are twice as sensitive to negative expected returns as to positive expected returns__. However, when evaluating experienced returns, the effect diminishes by more than half and is well __below commonly found loss aversion coefficients__. 
+ This suggests that __a large part of investors' financial loss aversion results from an affective forecasting error__.
