# Theory
## Left Behind: Creative Destruction, Inequality, and the Stock Market
25 January 2020 from [JPE](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be07/eb9c6ff27f8fee51f98f44d82e29164d6ab2.pdf)
We develop a general equilibrium model of asset prices in which __benefits of technological innovation are distributed asymmetrically__. 

+ Financial market participants __do not capture all economic gains__ from innovation even when they own shares in innovating firms. Such gains accrue partly to the innovators, who cannot sell claims on proceeds from their future ideas. 
+ We show how __the resulting inequality__ among agents can give rise to __a high risk premium__ on the aggregate stock market, return co-movement and average return differences among firms,
+ and the failure of traditional representative agent asset pricing models to account for cross-sectional differences in risk premia.

## Consumption Fluctuations and Expected Returns
12 December 2019 From [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12870?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
This paper introduces __a novel consumption‐based variable__, __cyclical consumption__, and examines its predictive properties for stock returns. 

+ Future expected __stock returns are high (low)__ when __aggregate consumption falls (rises)__ relative to its trend and marginal utility from current consumption is high (low). 
+ We show that the empirical evidence ties consumption decisions of agents to time‐variation in returns in a manner consistent with asset pricing models based on external habit formation. 
+ The predictive power of cyclical consumption is __not confined to bad times__ and subsumes the predictability of many popular forecasting variables.

## Dynamically consistent alpha‐maxmin expected utility
17 November 2019 From [MF](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/201618/1/IMW_working_paper_593.pdf)
The alpha‐maxmin model is a prominent example of preferences under Knightian uncertainty as it allows to distinguish ambiguity and ambiguity attitude. __These preferences are dynamically inconsistent for nontrivial versions of alpha.__ 
In this paper, we derive a recursive, dynamically consistent version of the __alpha‐maxmin model__. 

+ In the continuous‐time limit, the resulting dynamic utility function can be represented as a convex mixture between worst and best case, but now at the local, infinitesimal level.
+ We study the properties of the utility function and provide an Arrow–Pratt approximation of the static and dynamic certainty equivalent. 
+ We then derive a consumption‐based capital asset pricing formula and study the implications for derivative valuation under indifference pricing.

## Turning alphas into betas: Arbitrage and endogenous risk
09 March 2020 from [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300441?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
This paper tests the idea that __financial intermediaries who act as arbitrageurs__ in the asset market __help determine the equilibrium risk of financial assets__. 

+ They do this by turning alphas into betas; assets with large abnormal returns attract more arbitrage and covary correspondingly more with systematic shocks to arbitrage capital. I show that this channel explains the cross-sectional variation in the funding liquidity and the arbitrageur wealth portfolio betas of equity anomaly portfolios. 
+ My results highlight that intermediaries who act as arbitrageurs not only price cross-sections of assets given risks but also actively shape these risks through the act of arbitrage.

## Does the Ross recovery theorem work empirically?
March 19 2020 from [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300763?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
Starting with the fundamental relation that __state prices__ are the product of __physical probabilities__ and __the stochastic discount factor__, [24] shows that, given strong assumptions, knowing state prices suffices to back out physical probabilities and the stochastic discount factor at the same time. 

+ We find that such recovered physical distributions based on the S&P 500 index are __incompatible with future returns__ and __fail to predict future returns__ and __realized variances__. 
+ These negative results are even stronger __when we add economically reasonable constraints__. Simple benchmark methods based on a power utility agent or the historical return distribution cannot be rejected.

# Method
## Stock Return Asymmetry: Beyond Skewness
28 January 2020 form [JFQA](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022109019000206?urlappend=%3Fsource%3Drss&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We propose two asymmetry measures for stock returns. Unlike the popular skewness measure, our measures are based on the distribution function of the data rather than just the third central moment. 

+ We present empirical evidence that the greater upside asymmetries calculated using our new measures imply lower average returns in the cross section of stocks.
+ In contrast, when using the skewness measure, the relationship between asymmetry and returns is inconclusive.

## What you see is not what you get: The costs of trading market anomalies
10 March 2020 from [JFE](https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/10161/15676/1/The%20Costs%20of%20Trading%20Market%20Anomalies.pdf)
Is there a gap between the profitability of a trading strategy on paper and that which is achieved in practice? We answer this question by developing __a general technique to measure the real-world implementation costs__ of financial market anomalies. 

+ Our method extends Fama-MacBeth regressions to compare the on-paper returns to factor exposures with those achieved by mutual funds. Unlike existing approaches, ours delivers estimates of __all-in implementation costs__ without relying on parametric microstructure models or explicitly specified factor trading strategies. After accounting for implementation costs, typical mutual funds earn low returns to value and no returns to momentum.


# Factor
## Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors
24 January 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12883)
We propose a model selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high‐dimensional set of existing factors explains. 

+ Our methodology accounts for __model selection mistakes__ that produce a bias due to omitted variables, unlike standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection. 
+ We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While __most of these new factors are shown to be redundant__ relative to the existing factors, __a few have statistically significant explanatory power__ beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past.

## Lazy Prices
29 January 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12885)
Using the complete history of regular quarterly and annual filings by U.S. corporations, we show that __changes to the language and construction of financial reports__ have strong implications for firms' future returns and operations. 

+ A portfolio that *shorts "changers"* and buys *"nonchangers"* earns up to 188 basis points per month in alpha (over 22% per year) in the future. 
+ Moreover, changes to 10‐Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm‐level bankruptcies. 
+ Unlike typical underreaction patterns, we find __no announcement effect__, suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.

##  Understanding Systematic Risk ‐ A High‐Frequency Approach
20 March 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12898)
Based on a novel high‐frequency data set for a large number of firms, I estimate __the time‐varying latent continuous and jump factors__ that explain individual stock returns. 
+ The factors are estimated using __principal component analysis__ applied to __a local volatility and jump covariance matrix__. I find four stable continuous systematic factors, which can be well‐approximated by a market, oil, finance, and electricity portfolio, while there is only one stable jump market factor. The exposure of stocks to these risk factors and their explained variation is time‐varying. __The four continuous factors carry an intraday risk premium that reverses overnight.__
