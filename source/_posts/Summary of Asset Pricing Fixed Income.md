## An incomplete equilibrium with a stochastic annuity
29 January 2020 from [FS](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00415-6?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We prove the global existence of an incomplete, continuous-time finite-agent Radner equilibrium in which exponential agents optimise their expected utility over both running consumption and terminal wealth. 
+ The market consists of a traded annuity, and along with unspanned income, the market is incomplete. 
+ Set in a Brownian framework, the income is driven by a multidimensional diffusion and in particular includes mean-reverting dynamics. 
+ The equilibrium is characterised by a system of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations, a solution to which is proved to exist under Markovian assumptions. 
+ We also show that the equilibrium allocations lead to Pareto-optimal allocations only in exceptional situations.

## Term structure modelling for multiple curves with stochastic discontinuities
15 February 2020 from [FS](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00416-5?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We develop a __general term structure framework__ taking __stochastic discontinuities__ explicitly into account. Stochastic discontinuities are a key feature in interest rate markets, as for example the jumps of the term structures in correspondence to monetary policy meetings of the ECB show. 
+ We provide a general analysis of multiple curve markets __under minimal assumptions in an extended HJM framework__ and provide __a fundamental theorem of asset pricing based on NAFLVR__. 
+ The approach with stochastic discontinuities permits to embed market models directly, unifying seemingly different modelling philosophies. 
+ We also develop a tractable class of models, based on affine semimartingales, going beyond the requirement of stochastic continuity.


## Yield Spreads and the Corporate Bond Rollover Channel*
13 March 2020 from [FS](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/24/2/345/5364026?rss=1&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
I show that the __pricing of a bond liquidity shock depends on the current size of a firm's bond rollover exposure__. 
+ Using US corporate bond transactions data, I find that a market liquidity shock induces __a larger yield spread increase among firms with nonzero rollover exposures__. 
+ This effect is more pronounced for credit risky firms and increases in the size of the rollover exposure. Furthermore, I show that tests that do not control for the heterogeneity in firms' rollover exposure policies provide biased estimates of the pricing impact of the rollover channel.

## Informed Trading in Government Bond Markets
1 June 2021 from [JFE](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.med.nyu.edu/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002427?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
Using comprehensive administrative data from the UK, we examine trading by different investor types in government bond markets. 
+ Our sample covers virtually all secondary market trading in gilts and contains detailed information on each transaction, including the identities of both counterparties. 
+ We find that hedge funds’ daily trading positively forecasts gilt returns in the following one to five days, which is then fully reversed in the following month. 
    + A part of this short-term return predictability is due to __hedge funds’ ability to predict other investors’ future demand__. 
+ Mutual fund trading also positively predicts gilt returns, but over a longer horizon of one to two months. 
    + This return pattern does not revert in the following year and is partly due to mutual funds’ ability to forecast changes in short-term interest rates.
