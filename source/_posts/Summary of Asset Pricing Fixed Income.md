We prove the global existence of an incomplete, continuous-time finite-agent Radner equilibrium in which exponential agents optimise their expected utility over both running consumption and terminal wealth. 
+ The market consists of a traded annuity, and along with unspanned income, the market is incomplete. 
+ Set in a Brownian framework, the income is driven by a multidimensional diffusion and in particular includes mean-reverting dynamics. 
+ The equilibrium is characterised by a system of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations, a solution to which is proved to exist under Markovian assumptions. 
+ We also show that the equilibrium allocations lead to Pareto-optimal allocations only in exceptional situations.

## Term structure modelling for multiple curves with stochastic discontinuities

We develop a __general term structure framework__ taking __stochastic discontinuities__ explicitly into account. Stochastic discontinuities are a key feature in interest rate markets, as for example the jumps of the term structures in correspondence to monetary policy meetings of the ECB show. 
+ We provide a general analysis of multiple curve markets __under minimal assumptions in an extended HJM framework__ and provide __a fundamental theorem of asset pricing based on NAFLVR__. 
+ The approach with stochastic discontinuities permits to embed market models directly, unifying seemingly different modelling philosophies. 
+ We also develop a tractable class of models, based on affine semimartingales, going beyond the requirement of stochastic continuity.


## Yield Spreads and the Corporate Bond Rollover Channel*

I show that the __pricing of a bond liquidity shock depends on the current size of a firm's bond rollover exposure__. 
+ Using US corporate bond transactions data, I find that a market liquidity shock induces __a larger yield spread increase among firms with nonzero rollover exposures__. 
+ This effect is more pronounced for credit risky firms and increases in the size of the rollover exposure. Furthermore, I show that tests that do not control for the heterogeneity in firms' rollover exposure policies provide biased estimates of the pricing impact of the rollover channel.
