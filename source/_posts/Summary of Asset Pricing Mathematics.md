# Stochastic Processes
## Regime switching affine processes with applications to finance
21 February 2020 From [FS](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00419-2?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We introduce the notion of a __regime switching affine process__. Informally this is a Markov process that behaves conditionally on each regime as an affine process with specific parameters. To facilitate our analysis, specific restrictions are imposed on these parameters. The regime switches are driven by a Markov chain. 

+ We prove that the joint process of the Markov chain and the conditionally affine part is a process with an affine structure on an enlarged state space, conditionally on the starting state of the Markov chain. 
+ Like for affine processes, the characteristic function can be expressed in a set of ordinary differential equations that can sometimes be solved analytically. This result unifies several semi-analytical solutions found in the literature for pricing derivatives of specific regime switching processes on smaller state spaces. 
+ It also provides a unifying theory that allows us to __introduce regime switching to the pricing of many derivatives within the broad class of affine processes__. Examples include European options and term structure derivatives with stochastic volatility and default. 
+ Essentially, whenever there is a pricing solution based on an affine process, we can extend this to a regime switching affine process without sacrificing the analytical tractability of the affine process.

## The value of informational arbitrage
11 February 2020 from [FS](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00418-3?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
In the context of a general __semimartingale model__, we aim at determining how much an investor is willing to pay to learn additional information that allows achieving arbitrage. If such a value exists, we call it the value of informational arbitrage. We are interested in the case where the information yields arbitrage opportunities but not unbounded profits with bounded risk. As in Amendinger et al. (Finance Stoch. 7:29–46, 2003), we rely on an indifference valuation approach and study optimal consumption–investment problems under initial information and arbitrage. We establish some new results on models with additional information and characterise when the value of informational arbitrage is universal.

## Semimartingale theory of monotone mean–variance portfolio allocation
05 March 2020 from [MF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06912)
We study dynamic optimal portfolio allocation for monotone mean–variance preferences in a general semimartingale model. Armed with new results in this area, we revisit the work of Cui et al. and __fully characterize the circumstances under which one can set aside a nonnegative cash flow while simultaneously improving the mean–variance efficiency of the left‐over wealth.__ The paper analyzes, for the first time, the __monotone hull of the Sharpe ratio__ and highlights its relevance to the problem at hand.

## Optimal equilibria for time‐inconsistent stopping problems in continuous time
06 March 2020 from [MF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07806)
For an infinite‐horizon continuous‐time optimal stopping problem under nonexponential discounting, we look for an optimal equilibrium, which generates larger values than any other equilibrium does on the entire state space. 

+ When the discount function is log sub‐additive and the state process is one‐dimensional, an optimal equilibrium is constructed in a specific form, under appropriate regularity and integrability conditions. 
+ Although there may exist other optimal equilibria, we show that they can differ from the constructed one in very limited ways. This leads to a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of optimal equilibria, up to some closedness condition. 
+ To illustrate our theoretic results, comprehensive analysis is carried out for three specific stopping problems, concerning asset liquidation and real options valuation. For each one of them, an optimal equilibrium is characterized through an explicit formula.

# Hedging nontradable risks with transaction costs and price impact
12 March 2020 from [MF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00054)
A risk‐averse agent hedges her exposure to a nontradable risk factor U using a correlated traded asset S and accounts for the impact of her trades on both factors. __The effect of the agent's trades on U is referred to as cross‐impact__. By solving the agent's stochastic control problem, we obtain a closed‐form expression for __the optimal strategy__ when the agent holds a linear position in U. 

+ When the exposure to the nontradable risk factor is nonlinear, we provide an approximation to __the optimal strategy in closed‐form__, and prove that the value function is correctly approximated by this strategy when cross‐impact and risk‐aversion are small. 
+ We further prove that when is nonlinear, the approximate optimal strategy can be written __in terms of the optimal strategy for a linear exposure with the size of the position changing dynamically__ according to the exposure's "Delta" under a particular probability measure.

# Utility Function
## Consumption in incomplete markets
09 March 2020 from [FS](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-020-00420-9?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We develop a method to find approximate solutions, and their accuracy, to __consumption–investment problems__ with isoelastic preferences and infinite horizon, in incomplete markets where __state variables follow a multivariate diffusion__. 

+ We construct upper and lower contractions; these are fictitious complete markets in which state variables are fully hedgeable, but their dynamics is distorted. Such contractions yield pointwise upper and lower bounds for both the value function and the optimal consumption of the original incomplete market, and their optimal policies are explicit in typical models. Approximate consumption–investment policies coincide with the optimal one if the market is complete or utility is logarithmic.

## Shortfall aversion
05 March 2020 from [MF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mafi.12239?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
__Shortfall aversion__ reflects the __higher utility loss of spending cuts from a reference__ than __the utility gain from similar spending increases__. Inspired by Prospect Theory's loss aversion and the peak‐end rule, this paper posits a model of utility from __spending scaled by past peak spending__. 

+ In contrast to traditional models, which call for spending rates proportional to wealth, __the optimal policy in this model__ implies __a constant spending rate equal to the historical peak__ when wealth is relatively large. The spending rate increases when wealth reaches a model‐determined multiple of peak spending. In 1926–2015, shortfall‐averse spending is smooth and typically increasing.

## Partial liquidation under reference-dependent preferences
16 March 2020 from [FS](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00780-020-00421-8.pdf)
We propose __a multiple optimal stopping model__ where __an investor can sell a divisible asset position at times of her choosing__. 

+ Investors have -shaped reference-dependent preferences, whereby utility is defined over gains and losses relative to a reference level and is concave over gains and convex over losses. 
+ For a price process following a time-homogeneous diffusion, we employ the constructive potential-theoretic solution method developed by Dayanik and Karatzas (Stoch. Process. Appl. 107:173–212, 2003). 
    + As an example, we revisit the single optimal stopping model of Kyle et al. (J. Econ. Theory 129:273–288, 2006) to allow partial liquidation. 
    + In contrast to the extant literature, we find that the investor may partially liquidate the asset at distinct price thresholds above the reference level. 
+ Under other parameter combinations, the investor sells the asset in a block, either at or above the reference level.

## Time Lotteries and Stochastic Impatience
20 March 2020 from [Econometrica](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/102564/1/TimeLotteries.pdf)
We study __preferences over lotteries in which both the prize and the payment date are uncertain.__ In particular, a time lottery is one in which the prize is fixed but the date is random. 
+ With Expected Discounted Utility, __individuals must be risk seeking over time lotteries (RSTL)__. In an incentivized experiment, however, we find that almost all subjects violate this property. Our main contributions are theoretical. 
+ We first show that within a very broad class of models, which includes many forms of nonexpected utility and time discounting, it is impossible to accommodate even a single violation of RSTL without also violating a property we termed Stochastic Impatience, a risky counterpart of standard Impatience. 
+ We then present two positive results. 
    + If one wishes to __maintain Stochastic Impatience__, violations of RSTL can be accommodated by keeping Independence within periods while relaxing it across periods. 
    + If, instead, one is willing to __forego Stochastic Impatience__, violations of RSTL can be accommodated with a simple generalization of Expected Discounted Utility, obtained by imposing only the behavioral postulates of Discounted Utility and Expected Utility.
