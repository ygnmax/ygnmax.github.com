## Heterogeneity and Persistence in Returns to Wealth
July 2018

We provide a systematic __analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth__ using 12 years of population data from Norway's administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. 

+ First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. 
+ Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: __returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes__. 
+ Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax returns). 
+ Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. 
+ Finally, __wealth returns are correlated across generations__. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.

## Genetic Endowments and Wealth Inequality
29 Feb 2020 from JPE
http://www.nber.org/papers/w24642.pdf
We show that __genetic endowments__ linked to __educational attainment__ strongly and robustly predict __wealth at retirement__. The estimated relationship is not fully explained by flexibly controlling for education and labor income. 
+ We therefore investigate a host of additional mechanisms that could account for the gene-wealth gradient, including inheritances, mortality, risk preferences, portfolio decisions, beliefs about the probabilities of macroeconomic events, and planning horizons. 
+ We provide evidence that genetic endowments related to __human capital accumulation__ are associated with wealth not only through __educational attainment and labor income__ but also through __a facility with complex financial decision-making__.
