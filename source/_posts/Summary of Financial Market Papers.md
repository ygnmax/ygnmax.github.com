# High-Frequency Trading
## High‐Frequency Trading and Market Performance

23 January 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12882)
We study the consequences of, and potential policy responses to, high‐frequency trading (HFT) via the __tradeoff between liquidity and information production__. Faster speeds facilitate HFT, with consequences for this tradeoff: 

+ information production decreases because informed traders have less time to trade before HFTs react, 
+ but liquidity (measured by the bid‐ask spread) improves because informational asymmetries decline.
+ HFT also pushes outcomes inside the frontier of this tradeoff. However, outcomes can be restored to the frontier by replacing the limit order book with one of two alternative mechanisms: 
  + delaying all orders except cancellations or 
  + implementing frequent batch auctions.

# Market Structure
##  Thickness and Information in Dynamic Matching Markets
01 Feb 2020 from [JPE](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/704761?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We introduce a simple model of dynamic matching in networked markets, where __agents arrive and depart stochastically__ and the __composition of the trade network depends endogenously on the matching algorithm__. 

+ If the planner can identify agents who are about to depart, then waiting to thicken the market substantially reduces the fraction of unmatched agents. 
+ If not, then matching agents greedily is close to optimal. 
+ We specify conditions under which local algorithms that choose the right time to match agents, but do not exploit the global network structure, are close to optimal.
+ Finally, we consider a setting where agents have private information about their departure times and design a mechanism to elicit this information.

## Investor Experiences and Financial Market Dynamics
15 November 2019 [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X19302703?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
How do macrofinancial shocks affect investor behavior and market dynamics? Recent evidence on experience effects suggests a __long-lasting influence__ of personally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment but also significant differences across older and younger generations. 

+ We formalize experience-based learning in an __overlapping generations (OLG) model__, where different cross-cohort experiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices, and trade. The model allows us to __characterize a novel link between investor demographics and the dependence of prices__ on past dividends while also generating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return predictability. 
+ The model produces new implications for the cross-section of __asset holdings, trade volume, and investors' heterogeneous__ responses to recent financial crises, which we show to be in line with the data.

## Mean‐field games with differing beliefs for algorithmic trading
26 February 2020 From [MF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06101)
Even when confronted with the same data, agents often disagree on a model of the real world. Here, we address the question of __how interacting heterogeneous agents, who disagree on what model the real world follows, optimize their trading actions.__ 
The market has __latent factors__ that drive prices, and agents account for the permanent impact they have on prices. This leads to a large stochastic game, where each agents performance criteria are computed under a different probability measure. 
We analyze the __mean‐field game (MFG) limit of the stochastic game__ and show that the Nash equilibrium is given by the solution to a nonstandard vector‐valued forward–backward stochastic differential equation. 

+ Under some mild assumptions, we construct the solution in terms of expectations of the filtered states. 
+ Furthermore, we prove that the MFG strategy forms an ε‐Nash equilibrium for the finite player game. 
+ Finally, we present a least square Monte Carlo based algorithm for computing the equilibria and show through simulations that increasing disagreement may increase price volatility and trading activity.
## What Matters to Individual Investors? Evidence from the Horse's Mouth
27 Feb 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12895)
We survey a representative sample of U.S. individuals about __how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and decisions__. 

+ We find substantial support for many factors hypothesized to affect portfolio equity share, particularly background risk, investment horizon, rare disasters, transactional factors, and fixed costs of stock market participation. 
+ Individuals tend to believe that __past mutual fund performance is a good signal of stock‐picking skill__, actively managed funds do not suffer from diseconomies of scale, value stocks are safer and do not have higher expected returns, and __high‐momentum stocks are riskier and do have higher expected returns__.

# Fund
## Star Ratings and the Incentives of Mutual Funds
01 Feb 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12888?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We propose a theory of reputation to explain how investors rationally respond to mutual fund star ratings. 

+ A fund's performance is determined by its information advantage, which can be acquired but decays stochastically. 
    + Investors form beliefs about whether the fund is informed based on its past performance. 
    + We refer to such beliefs as __fund reputation, which determines fund flows__. 
+ __As performance changes continuously, equilibrium fund reputation may take discrete values__ only and thus can be labeled with stars. 
    + __Star upgrades thus imply reputation jumps__, leading to discrete increases in flows and expected performance, although __stars do not provide new information__.

## Prime (information) brokerage
20 February 2020 from [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2030043X?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We show that __hedge funds gain an information advantage__ from their prime broker banks regarding the banks' corporate borrowers. The connected hedge funds make abnormally large trades in the stocks of borrowing firms prior to loan announcements, and these trades outperform other trades. 
The outperformance is particularly strong for trades of hedge funds that have high revenue potential for prime broker banks. These informed trades appear to be based on information __not just about the loan itself__ but also about __firms' fundamentals such as future earnings__. Finally, we find evidence suggesting that equity analysts inside the banks are one potential conduit of information transfer.

# OTC
## Dynamic Asset Sales with a Feedback Effect
10 June 2019 from [RFS](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/2/829/5513178?rss=1&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)

+ I analyze a dynamic model of over-the-counter asset sales in which the seller receives stock-sensitive compensation, and the transaction conveys information about the firm's value. 
+ I examine how the market's response to an asset sale feeds back to the seller's decision on the timing and the sale price and analyze the unique pattern of stock prices before and after the sale. 
+ The implications of bargaining power, inventories, gains from synergy, and the introduction of a vesting period are discussed. 
+ The model sheds light on observed properties of corporate sell-offs and explains market dry-ups during downturn periods. 

## Pricing and Liquidity in Decentralized Asset Markets
02 December 2019 from [Econometrica](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/73901/1/MPRA_paper_73901.pdf)
I develop a search‐and‐bargaining model of __endogenous intermediation__ in over‐the‐counter markets. Unlike the existing work, my model __allows for rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions: preferences, inventories, and meeting rates__. 

+ By comparing trading‐volume patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue that __the heterogeneity in meeting rates__ is the main driver of intermediation patterns. 
+ I find that investors with higher meeting rates (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: 
    + (i) fast investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and 
    + (ii) fast investors hold more extreme inventories. 
+ Then, I use the model to study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of liquidity. 
    + On social welfare, I show that __the interaction of meeting rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management__ makes the equilibrium __inefficient__. 
    + I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors cross‐subsidize slow investors.

## Swap Trading after Dodd-Frank: Evidence from Index CDS
19 March 2020 from [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300787?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that certain standard over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives __must be traded on swap execution facilities (SEFs)__. Using message-level data, we provide __a granular analysis of dealers' and customers' trading behavior__ on the two largest dealer-to-customer SEFs for index credit default swaps (CDS). 

+ On average, a typical customer contacts few dealers when seeking liquidity. A theoretical model shows that the benefit of competition through wider order exposure is mitigated by a winner's curse problem and dealer-customer relationships. 
+ Consistent with the model, we find that __order size__, __market conditions__, and __customer-dealer relationships__ are important empirical determinants of customers' choice of trading mechanism and dealers' liquidity provision.

# Crisis
## Informational Channels of Financial Contagion
05 February 2020 from [Econometrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA15604?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
+ Two main classes of channels are studied as informational sources of financial contagion. 
    + One is a __fundamental channel__ that is based on real and financial links between economies, and 
    + the second is a __social learning channel__ that arises when agents base their decisions on noisy observations about the actions of others in foreign markets. 
+ Using global games, I present a two‐country model of financial contagion in which both channels can operate and I test its predictions experimentally. 
    + The experimental results show that subjects do not extract information optimally, which leads to two systematic biases that affect these channels directly. 
    + Base‐rate neglect leads subjects to underweight their prior, and thus weakens the fundamental channel. 
    + An overreaction bias strengthens the social learning channel, since subjects rely on information about the behavior of others, even when this information is irrelevant. These results have significant welfare effects rooted in the specific way in which these biases alter behavior.

## The Importance of Being Special: Repo Markets During the Crisis
13 February 2020 from [JFE](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2065.en.pdf)
We study __how the Italian sovereign bond scarcity premia, specialness, in the repo market__ were __affected by the European Central Bank (ECB)'s purchases__ during the euro area sovereign debt crisis. 

+ We propose and calibrate a __search-based dynamic model__ with a central bank acting as a buy-and-hold investor. Consistent with model predictions, ECB purchases drive specialness of targeted securities in combination with short-selling. 
+ Special benchmark bonds entail a positive cash premium, but their market liquidity decreases when purchased by the ECB. Short-sellers were more likely to fail-to-deliver very special bonds, while holders of these bonds were less inclined to pledge them as collateral to the ECB liquidity operations.

## Informational Frictions and the Credit Crunch
19 March 2020 from [JF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jofi.12900)
In this paper, I estimate the __magnitude of an informational friction limiting credit reallocation__ to firms during the 2007‐2009 financial crisis. 

+ Because lenders rely on private information when deciding which relationship to end, __borrowers looking for a new lender are adversely selected__. 
+ I show how to separately identify private information from information common to all lenders but unobservable to the econometrician by using bank shocks within a discrete choice model of relationships. 
+ __Quantitatively, these informational frictions appears to be too small to explain the credit crunch in the U.S. syndicated corporate loan market.__

## Anatomy of a liquidity crisis: Corporate bonds in the COVID-19 crisis
1 June 2021 from [JFE](https://doi-org.ezproxy.med.nyu.edu/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.05.052)
We examine the microstructure of liquidity provision in the COVID-19 corporate bond liquidity crisis. During the two weeks leading up to Federal Reserve System interventions, __volume shifted to liquid securities, transaction costs soared, trade-size pricing inverted, and dealers, particularly non-primary dealers, shifted from buying to selling, causing dealers' inventories to plummet__. 
+ Liquidity provisions in electronic customer-to-customer trading increased, though at prohibitively high costs. By improving dealer funding conditions and providing a liquidity backstop, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) stabilized trading conditions. Most of the impact of SMCCF on bond liquidity seems to have materialized following its announcement. 
+ We argue that the Federal Reserve's actions reflect a new role as market maker of last resort. 

# Phenomenon / Products
## Pre-Trade Hedging: Evidence from the Issuance of Retail Structured Products
12 February 2020 from [JFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300374?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
We find evidence consistent with previously unrecognized market manipulation by broker-dealers. Specifically, __we show that pre-trade hedging, which is distinct from front-running, alters prices at which derivative trades occur__. We show this behavior is intentional by exploiting variation in the design of structured equity products (SEPs). We find positive abnormal returns on SEP pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar SEPs. We also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when SEP issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices.

# International Finance / Regulation
## Does regulatory cooperation help integrate equity markets?
1 June 2021 from [JFE](https://doi-org.ezproxy.med.nyu.edu/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.05.040)
This study tests __whether cooperation between securities regulators influences global market integration__. 
+ I measure cooperation using arrangements between securities regulators that enable enhanced cross-border enforcement, better regulatory decisions, and reduced compliance obligations for cross-border activities. 
+ These arrangements—formed at different times for different country pairs—are associated with an 11% increase in cross-border investment. I find similar increases using other proxies for market integration. 
+ Cross-border investment and market integration thus depend, in part, on regulators working together to extend legal and institutional capacities across borders. This reframes our understanding of the role of institutions in global capital markets.

## Exchange Rate Disconnect in General Equilibrium
7 June 2021 from [JPE](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714447)
We propose a dynamic general equilibrium model of exchange rate determination that accounts for all major exchange rate puzzles, including __Meese-Rogoff__, __Backus-Smith__, __purchasing power parity__, and __uncovered interest rate parity puzzles__. 
+ We build on a standard international real business cycle model with home bias in consumption, augmented with shocks in the financial market that result in a volatile near-martingale behavior of exchange rates and ensure their empirically relevant comovement with macroeconomic variables, both nominal and real. 
+ Combining financial shocks with conventional productivity and monetary shocks allows the model to reproduce the exchange rate disconnect properties without compromising the fit of the business cycle moments.
