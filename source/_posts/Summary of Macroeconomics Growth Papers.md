# Global Economy
## The Global Diffusion of Ideas
05 February 2020

We provide a tractable, quantitatively‐oriented theory of innovation and technology diffusion to explore __the role of international trade in the process of development__. 
+ We model innovation and diffusion as a process involving the combination of new ideas with insights from other industries or countries. 
  
    + We provide conditions under which each country’s equilibrium frontier of knowledge converges to a Fréchet distribution, and derive a system of differential equations describing the evolution of the scale parameters of these distributions, that is, __countries’ stocks of knowledge__. 
+ The model remains tractable with many asymmetric countries and generates a rich set of predictions about __how the level and composition of trade affect countries' frontiers of knowledge__. 
    + We use the framework to quantify the contribution of bilateral trade costs to long‐run changes in TFP and individual post‐war growth miracles. 
    + For our preferred calibration, we find that both gains from trade and the fraction of variation of TFP growth accounted for by changes in trade more than double relative to a model without diffusion.

## Geography, Transportation, and Endogenous Trade Costs

In this paper, we study __the role of the transportation sector in world trade.__ 
+ We build a spatial model that centers on __the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods__. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model. 
+ We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector __
    + (i) attenuates differences in the comparative advantage across countries; 
    + (ii) generates network effects in trade costs; and 
    + (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. 
    + These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that was previously concealed by the frequently‐used assumption of exogenous trade costs. 
+ Finally, we illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and existing infrastructure projects (e.g., Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).

## Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change
https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/3/1024/5735312?rss=1&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound
Geophysicists examine and document the repercussions for the earth's climate induced by alternative emission scenarios and model specifications. Using simplified approximations, they produce __tractable characterizations of the associated uncertainty__. Meanwhile, economists write __highly stylized damage functions__ to speculate about how climate change alters macroeconomic and growth opportunities. 

+ How can we assess __both climate__ and __emissions impacts__, as well as __uncertainty in the broadest sense, in social decision-making__? We provide a framework for answering this question by embracing __recent decision theory and tools from asset pricing__, and we apply this structure with its interacting components to a revealing quantitative illustration.

## The Balance Condition in Search‐and‐Matching Models
19 March Econometrica 
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA8356?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound
Most of the literature that studies __frictional search‐and‐matching models__ with heterogeneous agents and random search investigates steady state equilibria. Steady state equilibrium requires, in particular, that __the flows of agents into and out of the population of unmatched agents balance__. 
+ We investigate the structure of this balance condition, __taking agents' matching behavior as given__. Building on the "fundamental matching lemma" for quadratic search technologies in Shimer and Smith (2000), we establish existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics properties of the solution to the balance condition for any search technology satisfying minimal regularity conditions. 
+ Implications for the existence and structure of steady state equilibria in the __Shimer–Smith model__ and extensions thereof are noted. These reinforce the point that much of the structure of search‐and‐matching models with quadratic search technologies carries over to more general search technologies.
