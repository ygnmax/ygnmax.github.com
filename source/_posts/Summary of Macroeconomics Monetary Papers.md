# Monetary Policy
## Optimal Monetary Policy with Informational Frictions
28 January 2020 from JPE

We study optimal policy in a business-cycle setting in which firms hold dispersed private information about, or are rationally inattentive to, the state of the economy. The informational friction is the source of both nominal and real rigidity. 
+ Because of the latter, the optimal monetary policy does not target price stability. Instead, it targets a negative relation between the nominal price level and real economic activity. 
+ Such leaning against the wind helps maximize production efficiency. An additional contribution is the adaptation of the primal approach of the Ramsey literature to a flexible form of informational friction.

## Banks' Balance Sheets and Liquidation Values: Evidence from Real Estate Collateral
17 June 2019 from RFS

This paper finds that __declining bank equity or liquidity__ reduces __liquidation values of bank-owned real estate and accelerates the pace of asset sales__. 
+ Buyers of these assets earn significant returns for providing liquidity to banks, as prices tend to rebound sharply after sales by illiquid banks. 
+ Lower liquidation values also depress the prices of nearby real estate transactions. 
+ Policy interventions, such as equity injections and central bank asset purchases, increase liquidation values by providing institutions with the balance sheet capacity to slow asset sales. 
+ This evidence suggests that __balance sheet adjustments at financial institutions can explain real asset price dynamics__.

## One Central Bank to Rule Them All*

While global stock markets enjoy high returns on days surrounding Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, there is no comparable result for other central banks either internationally or, more surprisingly, domestically. __Neither announcement surprises nor currency moves drive these findings__, which hold even for stocks with a domestic focus. The difference in announcement premia is not explained by economy size, exposure to multinationals, or policy activism. 
+ We conclude that __the Fed exerts a unique impact on global equities__. Consistent with this hypothesis, uncertainty drops across global markets following FOMC announcements but not those of other central banks. 
+ Furthermore, the Fed is generally the leader among central banks in setting monetary policy.
