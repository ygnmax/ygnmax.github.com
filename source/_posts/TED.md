# How we need to remake the Internet

by Jaron Lanier

+ At the beginning of the Internet, most things are free.
+ The business model is with advertisement.
+ With the development, advertisement becomes not social network anymore, but "**behavior modification empires**".
+ "*It's a global tragic, astoundingly ridiculous mistake rather than a wave of evil*."
+ To remake the decision: 
	+ some people pay for internet service like subscription fee, "Peak TV".
	+ "Peak social media"
+ "We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, **the only way that can happen is if it's financed by a third person who wishes to manipulate them**"

#  Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers

by Steven Pinker

+ Everyday news: the worst year ever. But it is not a good understanding in the 21st century
+ Compare the same data between present and 30 years ago
+ rethink progress
  + Intellectual hate progress.
  + However, progress is a testable hypothesis.
    + Life, heath, sustenance, prosperity, peace, freedom, safety, knowledge, leisure, happiness
    + data shows we have made great progress in last several hundred years.
  + The progress is not included in news, which become steadily glummer.
+ Why don't people appreciate progress
  + a mental shortcut called "*availability heuristic*", which means that the easier it is to recall something from memory, the probable we judge it to be. 
  + nature of journalism
    + bad things happen quickly, but good things don't happen in a day. 
+ Isn't it good to be pessimistic?
  + to safeguard against complacency, to rake the muck, to speak truth to power.
  + However, it's good to be accurate: not only just morbid things, but also how to change them.
  + fatalism
  + radicalism
+ What cause the progress?
  + not mystical force, not a mysterious arc of history bending toward justice.
  + result of human efforts governed by an idea, Enlightenment.
+ Is progress inevitable?
  + progress does not mean good thing for everyone everywhere all the time.
  + progress is a problem-solving, which solve problems but create new problems which should be solved in turn
+ Does Enlightenment go against human nature?
  + in understanding our tribulations and woes, human nature is the problem. But human nature, channeled by Enlightenment norms and institutions, is also the solution.
