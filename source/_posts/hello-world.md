"Hello World" is a magic sentence for programmers, since it is said that Brian Kernighan first wrote and ran it in a tutorial of language B in 1973, which was  referred again in his book *The C Programming Language* in 1978. Because of the prevalence of this book, other programmers gradually started to write how to print "Hello World" in their books as the very first program. Afterwards it becomes such a tradition that almost all the programming books will follow it. So does the first web-page of my personal blog when generated automatically by github.

Personally speaking, I find that "Hello World" is amazing. For every beginner of programming like me, not only does "Hello World" sound like an appropriate greeting to the new code-world, but indicates the curiosity and a spirit of exploration, which fascinates me a lot. Moreover, it is also a kind of encouragement both for my exploration on this online platform and for my educational journey in several years. Therefore, I believe "Hello World" will be a good start for my personal blog and my life at the near end of the age 22.

I plan to make this blog an academics and profession oriented place, with some summarization of Mathematics, Computer Science, Finance or Economics idea, which is part of the reason why I call it Guangnan's Notes. Of course, I will post some stories and retrospect of my life, in a relatively formal way, on the blog. If you are interested in and curious about the other sides about me, please feel free to contact me on the social media.

So, Let's start. Welcome to Guangnan's Notes!
