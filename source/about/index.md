Hi! My name is **Guangnan Yang**, but you will mostly meet me as **ygnmax** on the internet. "**Max**" is my English name which is given by my first English teacher. Therefore, you can also call me **Max Yang**.

Now, I have received an offer of *Master of Science in Financial Engineering* from NYU Tandon School and been preparing for my oversea education. Before that, I was major in *Finance* with a *Bachelor of Economics* degree and minor in *Jurisprudence* with a *Bachelor of Laws* degree in Xiamen University. Please check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guangnan-yang/) to get more information about my profession and Curriculum Vitae.

This blog is aimed at honing my skills in Financial Engineering fields and recording my academic notes. Please check "[Hello World](https://ygnmax.github.io/2018/12/31/hello-world/)" to know the origin of "Guangnan's Notes".

Feel free to contact me via ygnmax@gmail.com. Alternatively you can find me from the social media listed on catalog.
