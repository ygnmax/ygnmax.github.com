Hi! My name is **Guangnan Yang**, but you will mostly meet me as **ygnmax** on the Internet. "**Max**" is my English name, which is easier to pronounce for those who are not a native speaker in Chinese. Therefore, you can also call me **Max Yang**.

I am a pre-doc research assistant at Wharton Business School after graduating as a *Master of Science in Financial Engineering* from NYU. Before coming to the United States, I was major in *Finance* with a *Bachelor of Economics* degree and minor in *Jurisprudence* with a *Bachelor of Laws* degree in Xiamen University. Please check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guangnan-yang/) to get more information about my profession and Curriculum Vitae.

This blog is aimed at honing my skills in Finance and Economics fields and recording my academic notes. Please check "[Hello World](https://ygnmax.github.io/2018/12/31/hello-world/)" to know the origin of "Guangnan's Notes".

Feel free to contact me via ygnmax@gmail.com. You can also find me from the social media listed on catalog.
